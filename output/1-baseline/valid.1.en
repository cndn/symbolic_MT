you know , of the big <unk> the travel and one of your bliss in the <unk> research is , with the people to live performances that , the old days you can remember . the your past , still in the wind will feel , you on the rain <unk> of touch , in the bitter dregs of the leaves the plants and taste .
just that know that <unk> still living beyond the milky way to travel , or the importance of myth the oldest on the inuit -- still a full of what are , that in the himalayas , the buddhists and still the breath of the <unk> tracking , which means , the central epiphany around the anthropology at the memory to call that 's the idea that the world , in the we live , not in a total of exists , but just as a model of reality , and as a a bunch of certain ways of these things that we know , <unk> succeed , in many generations of chose .
and of course , sharing , we all the same <unk> .
we 're all born . we get kids to the world .
we 're going <unk> .
we 're bound with the <unk> separation of the death , obviously , and it should we 're not surprise that we all the singing , dancing and and art , this .
but there 's the unique vocal cadence of the <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and plays it does n't matter , whether it , the <unk> , in the of borneo -- is , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior down in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> in the sahara . this is to the colleague , i a month ago in the desert , across 'm . or even a <unk> of the fact , on the <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us that 's still the other <unk> , some of thinking , other ways to an orientation behavior on the earth there .
and that 's an idea that , if you think about , with just hope for fractals .
and form of thousands of the world a net of <unk> and cultural life , that the earth <unk> and for the way of the earth as important is the biological <unk> , that you a biosphere .
you can , this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can and as the sum of thoughts and dreams , which is the ideas , inspirations -- and everything , the human imagination ever since the beginnings of consciousness , generated by to be defined .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
they did this symbol of all to what we 're and what we as an amazing <unk> species can do .
and just like the biosphere , wear away , they did this with the <unk> -- only with , greater our velocity .
not a biologist to the example , dare to suggest that 50 percent or more of all species in a the extinct we are , there 's just not true . and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> on the area of biodiversity -- is not the , which gives us as <unk> <unk> on the area of cultural diversity , is .
and the critical to be for that is a number of these languages .
than any of them in this room was born , were on the earth are 6,000 different languages spoken .
now is a language not just the totality of the vocabulary belongs , or a series of <unk> .
a language is an expression of human spirit .
you is a means , the soul of a culture has access to the material world finds oneself .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual and opportunities .
and of that are 6,000 different languages are today , as we 're here in monterey , sit , exactly half the not more in the ears of children <unk> .
they 're infants do n't even more about teaching . that is , if nothing done is , they 're actually been dead .
what might be lonely , as the silence <unk> , one of the past your people to be , your language to talk , no opportunity to have the wisdom of our science , or the hope they are supposed to ?
and yet , stamp this horrible epidemic of fact , somebody somewhere on earth , about . all the two weeks , because of two weeks , you kill a older , man and take the last <unk> an old language , in the grave .
and i know that some of you say , it 's not better than that ? '' was the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to be ? '' and i 'm saying , '' well , let this language , yoruba . let them <unk> be .
let them kogi . ''
and then they would suddenly realize , how it , if you their own language not could talk .
so i want you today , of on a trip across the <unk> take , a quick trip across the <unk> to try to you get to do , which actually been lost .
now there 's some of us , the way , forget that i , when i say `` different ways of being , '' really different ways of being mean .
take them up for this child the <unk> in the northwest , the amazon , the nation of <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from east , from the belly of sacred , snakes <unk> .
this is a seafaring people , which is not being cognitively far between the colors , blue , and green is different , because that <unk> the forest that the people depend , <unk> is .
they have a dip to language and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> is called , you have to marry someone , the one another language , talks .
so all this is rooted in the mythological past . that appear to of these big houses , in which of <unk> six or seven languages spoken to be , is , is that you never get it sounds , the one brain learns language .
they just hear , and start then to talk .
or , one of the <unk> tribes , which i ever lived have to the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first , in 1958 , peaceful and contact .

they threw a new photographs of , of the air down , what we as kind , gesture for them would . and forgetting that you that these people from the rainforest in her still never be something <unk> had seen .

but the <unk> killed , not only be with the spear .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of deaths were happening through <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations go back and found two million cases of natural death and when we the people with really something about <unk> , gave them to that one of the people that old , so it was that he 's because of his age , and we were killing him , with the spear .
but at they had a clear ignoring the forest , the amazing .
they were hunters who were able to the urine of an animal from 40 up of the smell and determine , which species , this was on .
in the early <unk> years , i got a really amazing job , when i was my professor in the harvard , he said , if i believe it be interested to have to go and the secret societies to infiltrate the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the venom , that this was used to <unk> to try to make sure .
to this sensation having a sense , there had , i want something about this really believe in the <unk> know , and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
the point , it 's , to a complex , forget about the world .
it 's interesting .
if i asked them to ask , the great world , or , what they would say ?
christianity , islam , in buddhism , <unk> or what .
a continent will always leave out , because that he was that it in sub-saharan africa is not religious faith to give him . course there 's a and <unk> 's just this is , this very prize-winning religious thought , during the tragic diaspora , the <unk> <unk> .
but what <unk> so interesting , is this is a relationship between the living and the dead .
the living give the spirit .
the spirit can of the large sail water of evoking , the answers on the rhythm of the dance , the soul of living in this temporarily leaving out to , so that the <unk> for a shiny moment , god will .
cram say the <unk> to , `` your white is in the church , and you talk about god .
we use dancing in the temples , and be able to god . ''
and because you 're obsessed , me , you going to the spirit <unk> . how you damage , added to be ?
you see these amazing demonstrations , <unk> in a had a , kicking and coal , without the burning <unk> , an amazing graph of the ability of mind at the body like to influence that it <unk> , if it in a state of the extreme , arousal , and then they will .
now , of all people that i met , to have this , the kogi from the sierra nevada and de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most exceptional .
all around the old <unk> civilization , the <unk> plain from colombia world , and in a result of conquest , moved , that people in a <unk> volcanic shield can actually , that over the <unk> plain there .
in a <unk> continent , were these people are the only that never of the <unk> conquered .
to the day now , they of a ritual that priesthood governed , the training to that priesthood is , is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> to the age of three and four years of their families are apart and in a <unk> world , the dark , in <unk> at a fab the glacier , for 18 years by that . two periods of each , nine years , you 're elected , the nine months of pregnancy , our smile , they in which of her mother to contribute to do you now <unk> in which resulted in the big mother .
and during this whole time , they are culturally express in the scores of society which effectively . values , the claim that that their prayer , and only their prayer , the cosmic scene -- or we can say that environmental issues -- the equilibrium that .
the end of amazing <unk> they are no one day , suddenly , out and the first time in your life , the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this <unk> moment of consciousness of the first of light , if the sun 's starting on the <unk> the remarkably good landscape to radiation , suddenly everything that they in abstract 've learned in scale of grandeur confirms . and the priest , which is back and says , `` you see ? it 's really , i want you 've told .
it 's so wonderfully . you have it to protect them . ''
they call the older brother and say that we have that we the younger brother who are , for the destruction of the world are responsible .
now this level of intuition is very important .
and if we of aboriginal and the landscape , think , and conjure we 're either <unk> and the old lady who the fancy , wild up , which in its kind of simplification of a <unk> idea is , or other thoreau and say , these people are more with the nature is connected , when we .
so , and then aboriginal communities are n't sentimental , you will of nostalgia , otherwise ill .
it is not a lot of room for the <unk> swamps , <unk> or the cold and windmills , from tibet , you have , but anyway , through time and my ritual a mysterious <unk> the world shaped , not on the idea is based , you 're close to be , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth , just existing technology can , because they 're in the human consciousness <unk> will .
now , which means that ?
it means that a little girl from the andes , in the think up the mountain in a <unk> is , the , or her destiny to determine , is a very , another person , and a different relationship to this resource , or this place have , as a little girl from montana , in the think up to a mountain under a bunch of stone is , washing away can be .
if he had a location of mind or a bunch <unk> is , is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor , which the relationship between the individual and the nature is defined .
i grew up in the woods of british , colombia , and i believed that these forests , there are , <unk> .
this made me to a other people as my friends , under the <unk> , believe that these forests of the abode of <unk> and the curved <unk> and the <unk> they are the <unk> the world in fact , righteous minds that they 're looking at their <unk> in would .
now , if you start by the idea to look at that these cultures across different realities are able to , you some of their extraordinary discoveries to understand , like . this plant here .
it 's a picture that i just last april , in the northwest , the amazon on .
this is <unk> , of a lot of you 've heard , the most sorts preparation , from the repertoire of the shamans live .
what <unk> so fascinating , is not only that <unk> potential of this <unk> , but of processing . it will actually from two different sources that . on the one side , there 's these wooden <unk> , the number of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , hallucinogenic , to . this <unk> by taking that 's about as if , a blue <unk> smoke on their minds put , it 's , but with the leaves of <unk> from the family , the <unk> with the name <unk> <unk> up .
this plant matter contains some very strong <unk> the top of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
if you 've even the <unk> have seen , this stuff twisted , this substance , you from different ways to make it also <unk> .
this <unk> to twisted that 's about how from a <unk> throw , <unk> of the baroque paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it 's no distortion of reality is , but the resolution of reality .
i have even with my professor , richard evan <unk> , the man , the psychedelic <unk> with the discovery of the magic fungi in mexico in the <unk> years , i started , about being discussed . i said that you these <unk> not as highly hallucinogenic categorize it was okay , in the moment in the you look at the effects of , you do n't know , there is to a <unk> to experience .
but the thing with <unk> is that you to do n't <unk> <unk> can be , because you through a in the human gut , <unk> enzyme , with names <unk> , <unk> .
they can only in conjunction with a different chemicals <unk> <unk> to the mao <unk> .
now that 's fascinating that the <unk> , in the <unk> in them are , <unk> of exactly the way we 're that is necessary to the <unk> to <unk> . you ask , so itself .
how can these people from a <unk> of 80,000 species <unk> plant these two , morphologically and not related to plant to find the world , on this way , combined , of <unk> version of creating so that the larger than the sum of its parts is ?
we use these great euphemism to try and error , what , to -- it turns out .
but we ask you the native americans tell you , `` for the talks to us . ''
so , which means that ?
this tribe , the <unk> , i 've got 17 different forms of <unk> , they all the great distance in the forest realize that for our eyes of as appear .
and then ask you , their taxonomy of see it , and they say , i thought , you do something of plants .
i mean , you know anything at all ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns out , that you any of 17 different varieties , <unk> absolute and they sing to a in a different <unk> .
now , that does n't give them ph.d. in the harvard , but it 's more interesting than <unk> to count .
so , that <unk> the problem is that , who 's out of us , the concerns of the hard to the native americans have , as <unk> and colorful , look , but somehow the past to , during the world , which our world , progresses .
so , the fact is that you that in the 20th century . , in 300 years , not for his righteous war or technological innovation will remember , but rather than to an era , in the we <unk> , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity around the earth , either 's going to support his or becoming passive accept . so this problem is not the change .
all cultures have again , to dance with new <unk> involved .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> were not less on the sioux , when you must bow and the arrow of tasks , as the americans who stopped americans , when you a horse and <unk> tasks .
ca n't change , and technology could threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it 's power . that could face the rule .
and where anything that , in the world <unk> , you will discover that these cultures , not the sinking of <unk> . that are non-zero-sum dynamic , and uncontacted peoples , whose existence through the visible very much , that 's the about their capacity of things , we go out . it , and the <unk> logging in the country of the <unk> is , a <unk> from asia , of <unk> , a seafaring people , that , one generation freely in the forest , living , and now <unk> and prostitution , the river in , from where you can see that even the river with the mud , polluted by going to the almost half of borneo , in the <unk> sea <unk> seems . of where the japanese <unk> at it to see are that are willing to their <unk> with the raw <unk> to fill that they do the forest away . or like in the <unk> , where it <unk> are , during the <unk> <unk> .
or if we in the mountains of tibet and go , where i <unk> much on , you that could face the political and dominance .
you know , the genocide that <unk> extinction of people 's kind of , but the <unk> , the destruction of lifestyle and the people , will not only one of , but generally , and <unk> as part of <unk> celebrated .
and you can the suffering <unk> n't understand , if you do n't it on <unk> level , you have seen .
and i went even with a young , or 6,000 of miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> by <unk> , <unk> and only when i , <unk> came , i saw the face the statistics of you hear . emotions inside the monuments , in the rubble , and of ash into . 1.2 million people that during the cultural revolution of the <unk> killed .

this meant that it during the chinese it immediately get killed .
his uncle '' bug living with their sanctity in the diaspora , the people to nepal and shortly .
his mother was locked up , than lenient punishment to -- for the crime as straightforward .
he was the age of two years in prison for the smuggled to , under your <unk> to hide , because they do without it does n't live .
the twin sister , these <unk> did <unk> , in a <unk> to the country .
one day in them out on them on a tags and around and for these <unk> had them for seven years in a heavy , labor .
the suffering <unk> can become intolerable , but the <unk> spirit of people 's something <unk> .
and the end up , that we really , a choice . we want in a <unk> world , the <unk> or in a <unk> world , the diversity of life ?
margaret mead , now , the anthropologist who said before they died , that 's their greatest fear is that as we , a thread , <unk> , compounds and at the world move , we 're not just the whole range of human imagination , a <unk> way down would see , but that we one day from a dream up , and i 've forgotten , that 's one of any other possibilities that there .
and it 's really humbling to it to think that our species , perhaps been over 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution , the agriculture and so , and us this moment in the cult of the <unk> <unk> , the poetry , the shamans live by the purple prose the priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and a surplus , created -- and an hour ago , only about 10,000 years .
the modern industrial world as we know them is hardly see 300 years old .
well , these <unk> history tells me not that we all the answers on the challenges have , which we in the next for millennia to stand .
if we those thousands and <unk> after the importance of human questions , the answers you with 10,000 various voices .
and in this song , we become the opportunity to rediscover that , what we are , people with into consciousness , the importance are aware that all people and gardens , a space , are able to <unk> to deal . and there 's great moments of the optimism .
here 's a picture that i the northern tip of the end <unk> had taken , when i do with <unk> on the <unk> went . and this man , <unk> , i told me a wonderful story of his <unk> .
that matters into government is not always very well with the inuit -- the others and during the <unk> years of the establishment of figuring out , they were forced also , settlements , to move .
the grandfather of the old man who refused .
the family , the fear to be life was , i took him drink of guns and all the tools .
now to you know that the inuit -- not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> their <unk> , originally from fish , in <unk> wrapped up , it .
the grandfather of the man was afraid , not going on the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> , out , made his pants off from <unk> down and <unk> in his hand . and as the turbine , to seize that started , shaped , he goes , the form of <unk> .
he <unk> saliva , on the sides of the <unk> and when it are frozen was , <unk> he 's a dog with it .

so you come from nothing to do something .
and this is on many ways a symbol of the resistance , the inuit -- and all indigenous the world .
that matters into government had the inuit -- in april 1999 , the complete control over a field , that greater is a california , texas .
it 's our new home country , and i mean <unk> .
it 's a completely independent area . they control all <unk> .
a an example , as a nation , the state of atonement with its people , and can achieve .
and ultimately , i think , it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us , to these distant for the earth , across are , to realize that they do n't get away .
they are the <unk> of someone .
they represent the parts of human imagination , in times past the way back . and for all of us to be the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children in the geography of hope .
what we 've done in a national geographic , trying to do is that we believe that politicians ever get to achieve .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> not the case is , but we believe that storytelling in the world , and we 're probably the institution for storytelling in the world . our website , 35 million popular ones transmitted every month .
156 nations to send our tv .
our science magazines can be , read .
and we are taking a series of travel in the <unk> , which we our audience to places of such as cultural and wonder take you to the foot you by spreading . and hopefully , they become a after the other the central epiphany around the anthropology on one : that this world , it deserves this , on different ways to exist out that we have a <unk> in a really multicultural <unk> world can find , the wisdom of all people to our shared and well-being we can contribute .
thank you .
what i first , as quickly as possible , you 'll show , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we microsoft , as part of <unk> ago exactly a year , who have . this is <unk> . and it 's an environment , in either you locally . right away with huge amounts of visual data can deal .
we see many , gigabytes of digital photographs here , you will seamlessly , and that <unk> , pan , on any way to make arrangements .
and it 's no matter , how many of information , we look , how large that collections of these are or how big the images .
the most of you 're using digital photos of a camera , but this is , for a scan of the congress and it 's in one area of 300 <unk> .
it makes no difference , because the one , what the performance of like this is cut it , is the number of a pixel in your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible , architecture .
this is a whole book , a sample of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of <unk> . any tearing is a chapter .
to prove that is really to a text and not to a picture is , we can produce something like that do anything to really , showing that that 's an actual representation of the <unk> and not an image is .
maybe this is an artificial way , a <unk> to read .
i would it does n't recommend .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of <unk> .
and that there you really the pleasure and the good experience a real <unk> a magazine , or a newspaper to read , which is , sort of medium with several scales .
we 've also something , the corner of this special edition of the guardian did .
we have a wrong with this is very high , which are designed , much higher than with a normal this is , and we have more content to it .
if you the features of cars look like , they can see here .
or different models , or even a technical <unk> .
and that she really these ideas on , these constraints , there are a place on the screen arguments that .
we hope that we do n't add pop-ups and other nonsense , which means -- that should n't be necessary .
obviously this is that mapping of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i want this really not much to spend time , except to say that we also to this area that will .
but that are all roads in the united states .
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of the nasa .
you make us now something else out .
this is actually now live in the internet . you can it <unk> .
this is a project with the name <unk> that 's really two different technologies together .
the one is <unk> and the other is a very good the research <unk> , noah <unk> , a <unk> the university of washington , the advice from steve <unk> , <unk>
and rick <unk> of microsoft versus science programs did was . a very good working together .
so this is live in the internet . it will of <unk> by .
you can see that , if we these kinds of views , in which we by images through , can and this experience the <unk> , which is done .
but the spatial can still be the images here is , indeed , of .
the <unk> have these pictures together , lasted so you the real space , this footage that all in near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian rockies , were made , equal . you see here elements of stabilized slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in the relationship with myself on .
i do n't know , if i still time , to have you very different environments to show .
there 's what kind of a lot of spatial .
i 'd like for a the original pieces of test about showing and that 's about one of the early prototype of <unk> to work we first time in summer , ever have to give you that to show , i think that 's really the punch behind this technology , the <unk> is . and this is not so obviously , the environments , that we on the site .
we had the lawyers and so forth . about .
this is a <unk> the cathedral notre dame , lady , the only in computers with images from flickr and after . give you just going to notre dame , lady in the flickr , and they 're taking pictures of men in a t-shirt and on the <unk> so forth . get . each of orange <unk> represents a picture that as to this model <unk> was discovered .
so they 're this all <unk> , and they all stand in perspective on this way in the relationship with each other .
and we can be in this very simple way to navigate .
. you know , i 've never believed that i ended up at microsoft 're going .
i 'm very grateful for the inmates had this .
. i suspect , you can see that many different kinds of these are : it 's the of the <unk> to do it <unk> , a pretty large number of them , all in this environment me .
and when they can , i 'm a couple of weird to find .
many of you 're from their faces , with so forth .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here are you .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , lady , the right recorded was .
we can of the poster to a physical view this environment and change .
the point is here that we do things with the social environment , and then it can . it will now data from all gathered together -- the entire contents of memory of the way , visually , the planet looks -- and everything is going to each other .
all these photographs are connected to and it 's something that greater is as the sum of the parts .
they get a model that draws from around the earth , that .
at you see this as the sequel of labor , stephen <unk> of virtual earth .
and that 's something that by the complexity , the people use it , growing and to use for the user , with the application , is a greater .
their own photos to metadata <unk> , the one another person got masses .
if , somebody the trouble has done and all this kind of them , and becomes , who you 're all and it 's my picture of the notre <unk> suddenly , with all this data , held and i can put them as a point , in this space to come , in this <unk> , the photos of the other people use and so a kind of <unk> <unk> social experience with the usage of other players doing .
and of course , as all of the people are immense , the virtual models of any interesting part of the earth , not just by <unk> or a satellite and so on the were , but through collective of memory .
thank you .
. i do you right ? their software to to a certain point , within the next few years , all images , somebody in the world together to be used in principle of all linked to be ?
yes . they do not different than to explore .
you want me , made them to hyperlinks , between the images .
and they do this based on the content in the images .
and that 's really exciting , if you , plenty of semantic information i think that many of these images have .
as if you a <unk> for images make , where they got your and the the site itself contains a lot of information about that picture that is .
but how would it , if this picture of them with all their pictures of the reason ?
then is the circumference of the semantic <unk> and the wealth , it basically , really enormous . it 's a classic <unk> .
<unk> , that 's really incredible , congratulations .
you have much .
i 'll tell you some things from my book about the , i hope that in unison with other things are the they have heard . and i 'm trying to a couple of connections to create , if you this is n't have noticed .
i want to start , what i `` the official dogma binding . '' i call .
the official dogma of what ?
the official <unk> of any western industrialized world societies .
the official dogma in it 's so , if our target that to maximize the common our own citizens , is , about this , by the <unk> the freedom of the individual .
the reason for this is that freedom , in , is good , valuable to make sense , a <unk> principal requirement for the human .
when people freedom to have , it 's any of us for , the things to do that our public good to maximize and nobody has for us to decide .
the freedom to maximize that 's a choice to maximize coverage .
ever more choices , people have , more and more of freedom to have you . and ever more of freedom , they have , more and more common good have you .
this is , i think , so deeply in our water ones that 's not in the sense to get it would to ask questions .
and it 's also deeply in our lives rooted in .
i 'll tell you some examples of that there , which gives us modern progress that .
this is my big supermarket . not a big .
i just want to doing something about <unk> say .

so that 's what the supermarket .
and then they 're going to the <unk> business plan to a good stereo at an -- some speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , are . and in this one of electronics , which is there 's so many <unk> facilities .
we can <unk> millions of <unk> reason why i put out of the components , in a business are offered .
they must admit that a large selection is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there 's a time , when i 'm a boy was , because you could every phone , the purchaser would have the you wanted , as he , ma bell was .
they have your phone <unk> . you have n't it <unk>
a consequence of it was that the phone ever broken .
these days are over .
we 've now almost an infinite , choice , phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
that are the mobile phones , the future .
my favorite is the in the center -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> torch around .
and they should be that until now , not in your business and i 've seen , you can be sure that they do it 's going to be .
and what it does it 's going to help people to the business to go and this question is to start .
you know now what the answers that question is ?
the answer is `` no . ''
it 's not possible a cellphone , to buy that 's not to be much does .
in other aspects of life , the very much more important than that buy one of personify things are , the same kind of explosion of choices to .
health -- it 's not known for the case in the united states that you to the doctor , and the doctor says , you what to do .
instead they 're going to the doctor and the doctor says , you : why we have a to make or we could call b .
a , has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what you want to do ?
and they say , `` doctor , so what i do ? ''
the doctor says , a , has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you i would , doctor , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not you . ''
the result is -- we call it `` patient , autonomy . '' in this sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift the burden of responsibility for the meeting of decisions of someone to know -- namely the doctor -- to somebody on the n't know , and more tomorrow 's ill and why not in the best constitution , is a choice to meet -- namely the patient .
there 's such a marketing , <unk> medicine for people like , and me , that , if you think about , does n't make sense , because we do n't you buy .
why do gears for them to us , if we 're not able to buy ?
the answer is : they sort of us the doctor across the next morning to call and to a change the prescription to ask .
something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide to demonstrate .
we 'd not an identity , we make them .
and we make us so often to examine how we want .
that means that every day , if you the morning , wake up , you to decide , which for one of person they could be really want .
in terms of marriage and family , there 's a time , in the <unk> was that almost every one had and that you so fast , married soon as you could , and so fast as children got as you could .
the only true that election was `` who '' , not any day , and not what they do , we did .
nowadays everything is easy .
i 'm teaching been an intelligent , students , and i leave you 20 percent less at work as i used to be doing .
and that 's not because , smart are , and not because , carefully .
it 's because you with other things too are , you ask , , `` i have to marry , or not ? should i now , marry ?
i later , marry ? should i just have kids , or just have never do ? ''
that are all <unk> questions .
and they are these questions , regardless of if that 's all mean , in to do that i of being bullied , and no good note in my class to get one .
and , they should be here . and that are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we 're blessed , as carl that , with the technology that enables us to every minute of every day from any place on the planet to work -- until the <unk> hotel .
there 's actually a corner , of the i did n't tell me , the <unk> works .
i 'm it does n't tell you , because i use it wants .
so what it , this extraordinary freedom of choice we have in terms of making decisions to meet , and again , and again , whether we have to work or not have to work .
we can make our kids in the football games could n't look , and we have our mobile phone , a hip , and our blackberry , other hip , and our laptop probably going on our lap .
and also if you all off are , every minute , we our child , <unk> of a soccer never ask , we also , `` should i this call would ?
i should be in this email somebody answers ? should i 've got this letter writing ? ''
and also if the answer to the question `` no , '' is it certainly in your experience of the <unk> their children 's , cloaking them very different than it would have been .
everywhere , where we look , great things and little things that material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world , we were actually saw this .
so i want to say , there 's some of choices , but not it was a question of choice .
and the world , we now live looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is `` yes . ''
we all know what good at this is , so i 'm about what one of it 's .
all these choices we have two effects , two or negative effects on people .
a relativistic effect , <unk> way , is that he 's this , instead to be free .
with so many options out of the you pick it , it people very hard , in order to decide .
i 'm going to a another <unk> example going to give a study about investing in private voluntary <unk> .
a colleague of me had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million u.s. employees and i think about . 2,000 people different jobs .
and what they found was a 10 <unk> the of employers who offered it , i took the participation of the two percent .
they 're offering 50 <unk> to -- 10 percent less than their employees are taking part of as if you just five to be . why ?
because it 50 <unk> are the selection are , it 's so hard to decide what you choose to you to do it on the morning off .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's obviously never .
you know that 's not just means that people <unk> to eat when they come in retirement go , because they 're not enough money to them on , have , it also means that you 'll make this hard is that they big <unk> your employers who miss .
by the not participating in the give them to around the u.s. dollars per year on the future employer , the happy would have been their contributions to reproduce .
of this is a consequence of to many options .
and i think it it makes the world looks like this .
they like the decision really make , if it for all eternity is , right ?
they do n't want the wrong investment fund to vote , or even the <unk> .
so this is the an effect . the other side effect is that even if we that paralysis and over , and make a decision , by saying we have less happy with the result of the selection , as if we have the possibility of out of us between a few ways to decide .
and there 's several reasons for this .
one of them is contingent upon by the large selection of different <unk> , if you of buy , and it 's not perfect -- and , which <unk> 's been perfect imitation ? it 's easy , imagine that they have a different decision like you can meet the better would have been . and what happens is that visualize an alternative which leads to you to the decision to regret , and that we regret . so it against the average happiness , you some of their impacts the decision , as well , if it 's a decision was .
ever more opportunities there 's , more and easier is it does nothing to regret that 's getting there for the choice that they meet .
secondly , what economists <unk> .
dan , gilbert , has a big , the morning is made by he told as a very , the way , we evaluate things , it depends on to what we do it 's conceivable .
well , if it very many of alternatives to think there , it 's easy , attractive of one of alternatives , they exclude from that makes them less happy with the alternatives , they voted .
here 's an example . for the of them , no new york are , sorry i .
but here is , what they 're thinking to .
here 's a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous embodiment of the beach . great day . you have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? `` damn ! '' the man who thinks , `` it 's an august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood that 's gone .
i could directly , my house park . ''
and he spend two weeks of the thought of that he the opportunity again , day , one day , a great parking lot .
<unk> reduce the average happiness that we obtained by our choice and get , as well , if that what we think you 've been fantastic .
and ever more ways it on the choice , there , more and more attractive properties of choices be in the <unk> into account .
here 's a another example .
now , this cartoon is doing some statements .
he makes a statement about the right now to live and may also about things are slow to do .
but a very important point , he does is , and if you , for one thing to decide to do these other things not to do .
and these other things like many , attractive properties have , and it , what they 'll do a motivator .
three : <unk> the expectation .
this , i met , when i my jeans and they wanted .
i 'm dressed me , almost all the time .
and there 's a time in the it just me to a way that there , and they have you bought , and they have a bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if you long enough by and often enough clean , you have begun , `` ok . '' <unk> .
so i went to new me to buy , many years of <unk> the old , and i said , `` i 'd like a few jeans , here 's my size . ''
and the sales , `` you want to risk , <unk> or of the place ?
you want to do buttons , or <unk> ? rock or an acid would clean ?
you want to me with holes ?
you want to the bottom , cut , <unk> , blah ... '' and so he told .
my jaw was down and after i started rebounding , i said , `` i 'd like the way that used to the only way . ''
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all these up and jeans <unk> , and spread the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best put me , i ever did .
i did it better . all these choices that allowed it me it better .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book , to try it to myself to understand .
the reason for that i got felt was , with all this available for one , and expectations of that , which for a few jeans is , went up .
i had very low expectations . i did not the expectations , as it you just in a way that there .
when you in a hundred species that came to damn well , one of you have a perfectly to be ,
and what i got was good , but it was n't perfect .
and so i was i what i have had to what i expected , and what i was getting there in comparison to what i expected .
this add some of opportunities in the lives of people increases is the expectations of the people have about how well these opportunities to be .
and this gets to less great satisfaction with the results , the results .
nobody in the world of marketing manager knows that . because , if you it would say , you know what they all do n't comprehend what it 's the humans .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used everything was better than anything worse , was , than anything worse , was , it was for the people can see these things to make the a surprise was .
now , in the world , we live -- we 're wealthy , one thing that citizens , perfection arises when i went -- the best for that you ever greater hope it 's the things are so good as it a couple of you expect .
you 'll never have been surprised . because your expectations , and expectations , <unk> .
the secret to -- -- that 's what they all come out there are -- the secret to -- are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i do with a wife annie perasa married , i 'm , and they really is very beautiful .
i 'd let 's not much we can do . i did n't culturing .
but they preferred 's not always like a bad thing .
eventually , a consequence of the <unk> a bad at recognizing jeans , if it only one way to buy there is that if you 're thinking there are , and they ask why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of me are available , and they buy one of getting there is , and they ask why , who 's in ?
it 's also clear that the answer to the question is , you .
they have it can do .
with a hundred different kinds of me to the windows , there 's no excuse for error .
and so , when people make decisions , and also if you the results make decisions are good , you feel , very disappointed about , they actually to themselves .
clinical depression , exploded in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think a pretty whopping -- not the only , but a pretty whopping <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also the suicide , this is that people who 've learned that there are because their standards , so high . and then , if you , this experience itself to explain to , you think it would your fault .
and that 's <unk> that it 's generally better about , objective , and we 're bad feeling .
so let me take you remember .
this is the official dogma for that one that we all for right to completely false . it 's not true .
there 's no question that a choice is better than any weakness , but it is not , the more selection is better than a choice .
there 's a magical lot . i do n't know what it 's .
i 'm pretty sure that we 're going to that long as you have to preserve choices , our public good way .
now , as a policy question -- i 'm almost finished -- as a policy question , the thing about the thinking . that what all these choices to the world societies , is the material that wealth .
there 's many places in the world , and we have of many of you heard that problem is not the beginning to be large selection is .
your issue is that you to little bit .
so the things , i 'm talking about are a very odd thing with the modern , rich , that of societies .
and what 's so extremely frustrating and on is : steve levitt , you briefly yesterday about reddit tells how this is more and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i 'm telling you is that expensive , complicated patient making -- it 's not just that they do n't help .
they 're actually hurt .
they 're going into that we 've gone down there are .
if something of the what the people in our society to this big decisions to come to the powerful societies in which people to a choice 've shifted to say , would not only that life of people really improves , but we would also be improved .
economists call this one <unk> amazed .
<unk> going to worry that everybody 's better about -- not just the poor -- because all these large selection of us an educational .
finally , read you to this cartoon , and , a one person , says , `` ah ! what do this fish ?
you know it not possible in this <unk> . ''
<unk> imagination , a shortsighted , the world -- and that 's the way as i thought it to read .
ever more of but i thought about , more and more i came to the view , that the fish , that you know .
because the truth is that if you that <unk> break , so that it 's possible , you have no freedom . they have a lesion .
if you that <unk> break , so that it 's possible , down , the average happiness .
they increase the lesion , and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost with one of security to be limited -- possibly also for the fish , definitely upward for us .
but that <unk> be from a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for children , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i talked about some of projects have been talked , over the genome and what that could mean , and over the discovery of groups of genes .
in fact , we turn on from a new point , we have the biology and digitized , and now we try the digital code in a new phase of biology to get by we new life create , and to .
we 've always trying to great questions to imagine .
what 's life ? it 's something , i think that many biologists have tried to understand and this in a different levels .
we have different approaches tried to it until the minimum of the components to simplify them .
we have nearly 20 years of digitized . when we that <unk> have sequenced it was really , the transition from the analog world of biology to digital world , the computer .
now we 're trying to be asking whether we live , you what can or whether we new life to create , because of digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , the mycoplasma <unk> , the smallest genome of species has the time , in there are self-replicating . and we 've tried to see if we that with a still have smaller genome , you can achieve .
we 've done it on about a hundred genes to give up the 500 , or so , here .
but if we take those metabolic map at that are very simple is , in comparison to our . trust me , that 's pretty straightforward . but if we all those genes , watch that we one after the other them to it 's very unlikely that this to a living cell lead to fall .
so we 've determined that 's the only way to jump forward is that chromosome in fact , to synthesize , which allows us the top of the components to <unk> and some of the fundamental question is to start .
and so we started to the question , we can a chromosome , synthesize patterns ?
what it 's the chemistry that really big nano-molecular molecules to build this is still never been done before ?
and , if we can do that , we in the chromosome start ?
a chromosome , is that way , just a piece <unk> where fissionable material .
our essential steps in the digitization , of life were growing exponentially .
our ability of genetic code to write , very slowly that , but nevertheless , increased . and our final point was now , of an exponential curve that .
we 've got 15 years ago , so i started .
it actually a few years , starting with a <unk> review board before we the first experiments , and did .
like , turned out there 's <unk> hard .
there 's tens of machines around the world 's the little pieces of dna can make , 30 to 50 letter a long , but it 's a <unk> process , so ever known for you a piece of power , you cut more error happen .
so we had a new way to come up with the we these little pieces together and the error correct could .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 countries .
it 's a virus that the bacteria , kill .
we were little pieces , did a <unk> and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting to the came when we this piece <unk> chemical and in a bacterium , and this bacterium in the genetic code to read and viral particles .
the viral them were then the cells that would and they came back and killed , e. coli .
recently i did with the <unk> spoken and they said that you this model just figure out .
they were laughing , more than her , it 's doing .
so we think that 's a situation is in the software in fact that your hardware we can build in a biological system .
but we wanted , a lot go on . we want a whole <unk> chromosome ; building . it has more than <unk> letter of genetic code . so we thought , we build it in it on the size of the virus , what we need the size it <unk> able to understand what the top of the components of living cell .
design is the key , and if you with digital information in computers will just want to these digital access information that way to be .
when we the genome for the first in 1995 , have sequenced it was the <unk> in a mistake per 10,000 base pairs .
we found the <unk> 30 mistakes . if we the original sequence that 's used to have it would never been possible <unk> .
a part of the is it , and we chose to the minimum of letters for are and the with other <unk> pieces overlap . need to get smaller <unk> to build with these together .
we have a unique species of this into .
you might have heard that we <unk> into .
you think about it for : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> of letters -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino ; and there 's a single , what matters for each of amino acids .
so we in the genetic code using about our words , to write sentences , thoughts .
and we 've only signed .
some people were being that 's no new poetry was .
we have the pieces that 's that we just want you with enzymes , though they could . there 's that the this repair and to stitch back .
and we 've started pieces to create , starting with pieces of the five to <unk> letters in terms , added these people to <unk> to try to this back into , to <unk> .
in every step , we have these pieces in the surplus produced by that we sequence them were able to because we looked at a very robust process to create what they were in a minute to see .
we 've tried to point of <unk> to get .
so , this is sort of like a <unk> .
if we 're going to these really great happiness spontaneously rises to get -- with over 100,000 pairs in -- to then this is not just in the chuck e. coli that grow . it adds up all possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so well , we other policy mechanisms to .
we knew from a mechanism underlies the <unk> recombinations is called , the biology is used to disrupt dna to repair that these pieces together .
here 's an example of them . there 's one organism function called <unk> <unk> the three million ] bike , radiation , fine .
you see the top of the field to be a chromosome , just really just drops .
12 , 24 hours later , , it all over again this is how it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms that can totally <unk> , you can even in a vacuum .
i 'm absolutely certain extent to live in space that exists , can move , on the quest for <unk> conditions .
indeed , the nasa has shown that 's a lot of them out there are .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we 've created by we these things have used -- actually , we 've just <unk> used to the right design the pieces we have you <unk> . yeast and so these then automatically join together .
this is not <unk> it 's a regular micrograph .
it 's a big molecule that we do it even with the <unk> can see .
that are actual footage of a whole duration of six seconds .

that are about <unk> letters , hiding the code . it 's the largest molecule , <unk> structure that any of people who was created .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we do it with a <unk> of 10 and without the distances of print one would it would <unk> pages from just to this genetic code <unk> .
now , how we turn on a chromosome 7 ? how we activate it ?
obviously this is that it with a virus , very simple . it is more with bacteria to deal .
it 's also considerably easier if you know it in <unk> how we do it are doing , you just take the nucleus out and there was one else inside , and this is that 's exactly what they all over the advantage of about .
in <unk> is that chromosome in the cell into but recently , we have shown that you have a complete transplant of a pair chromosome from one cell to another that can make and these are .

this new synthetic chromosome in to the cell .
in fact , we thought that 's the end is , but we have the process , something on to earth .
this is the <unk> the evolution .
we find all kinds of species here , a second , the chromosome in order to have or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of the characteristics , just a second to a species <unk> .
people so , evolution can imagine , as a gene that 's going to a moment changed will have a lot of the biology , again .
there 's that the <unk> be called the fact , dna and digest .
that chromosome out that in the cell was has n't ; the chromosomes , we put them have already .

it <unk> , blue , because of the genes that we put them .
and after a very short time , it was all the characteristics of species forever lost and <unk> completely in a new species , based on the new software that we in the cell have given .
all these proteins and changed the membranes and changed , -- when we the genetic code to read , it was that 's exactly what we 're transferring aid .
it may sound like the genomic <unk> sound , but we can , by that we went <unk> here , things quite dramatic change .
now i argues that it 's not the <unk> is -- that 's based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argues that we possibly do that are a new form of the cambrian explosion to create in the it 's massive whole new <unk> based on this digital media design that there might .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty clearly in terms of what we need .
we 're doing that of six to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
now , it in my connection to ask : i was in 1946 , born .
today are three people on this planet for each of , in 1946 , it has ; within of 40 years , it 's four .
we have problems with food , with all-natural fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it 's a challenge that for nine to offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion for every oil . that are a hundred million every day of .
if we of biological processes to think , or any process to bring that replace , it 's a huge challenge .
then , of course , there 's the co2 from this material that in the end up .
we 've now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database , about 20 million of genes , and i believe in it predicts that the <unk> the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and you see , the diversity , it was .
we hit here in the first line of the edges of biological reality , and those , what we can .
we 've now technologies of these rapid <unk> the three to do what we <unk> genetics .
we 've now the possibility of a robot to build the millions of chromosomes , the day can create .
if you imagine those 20 million distinct flavors of genes are making or these redundant processes to optimize the octane make or drugs new vaccines , we can do with a just small team , a molecular biology to change as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we can , <unk> <unk> , one of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is a micrograph of that 's really <unk> , we work , you , actually sit down and new species on the computer to design <unk>
you know , we could n't necessarily as it will look . we know exactly how their genetic code looks like this is .
what we are now , switch fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently , corn to run ethanol seen what 's just a bad tv experiment .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation of the relatively soon drowned out to the much higher <unk> have to the octane fuel or different kinds of <unk> .
but , how we think , the only way to biology is a big impact , another spike in the cost on food or the disappointment of the availability that will have is , if we co2 as starting material can see , and therefore , we work of cells that way to go ,
and we think that we the first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that in about 18 months .
the sunlight and co2 you 're a method --
but -- in our discovery of the world , we 've all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism , we 1996 , described .
he lives in the deep , <unk> miles deep , in virtually <unk> <unk> .
it into carbon dioxide in the methane to under the use of hydrogen as energy .

within a short four-year time , we think , we could in the be able to one of basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we 've really -- <unk> goals , like the nutritional substitute the petrochemical industry . exactly when you do n't that ted , i could do , where else ? a <unk> the energy use .
but as we 're currently working very , the same two approaches to the vaccines to speak .
they have it this year with the flu in that we 're always a year of the back on and have a dollar to little bit , if the right lasts all about .
i think that it can be affected by showing you <unk> vaccines , have sufficient .
that 's the future , possibly could look with changes , can now the <unk> it also be with synthetic one bacteria , <unk> , and perhaps some <unk> .
we are light years of the people to innovate . our goal is it 's only that we have a chance long enough to survive to that potentially to do . thank you .
on the last ted conference , i put an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised you back to come to me to explain how the machine works .
now , it 's so here . and for all those at the n't there were , the lhc is the biggest increase science experiment , which you ever been approached by -- 27 more miles in diameter .
his job is it , the conditions to create , which fewer than a <unk> second , the universe <unk> -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just genes which i went from very much .
this is the machine , below , geneva .
we take pictures of <unk> in the detectors on .
of this , i work . he calls , an atlas off the detector , and 44 , up in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here 's a spectacular picture of an atlas off in the construction , so you the scale .
the 10 . september the last year was the machine , the first time .
and this picture was one of an atlas .
it was making huge <unk> in control room .
it 's a picture of the first <unk> which the way across the lhc <unk> , you 're dealing with a part of the lhc <unk> to a rain from the particles in the detector <unk> .
in other words , when we have this picture of 10 . september at , we knew that the machine works , what a huge victory .
i do n't know , whether this the biggest <unk> generated , this , when someone the google side to and the front page that i found was .
it means that we have a cultural shortcomings of the scientific trade .
about a week , there 's a problem with the machine that with these <unk> here to do was -- this golden wires , here .
those wires , run <unk> <unk> when the machine on <unk> .
now the engineers , you 're going to look at and say , `` no , that they do n't . that are small wires . ''
you can that contribute , because if you very far cooling , they going to call <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , can make those wires in the tension , endurance .
in the connections , between appearance of <unk> magnets used in the lhc , there 's a <unk> .
so heat , the wires are and <unk> <unk> out into a sudden <unk> resistance .
this was the outcome .
now , all this is still a wonderful when you imagine , that the magnets used over 20 tons weigh , to about . 30 inches move .
we were so about 50 the magnet
and they had to remove , what we also did .
we <unk> they 're going to say , <unk> you .
they 're now all back on their way back .
against the end of the march , is the lhc switches back <unk> be .
we 're going to him turn , and expecting the first data in june , or maybe july , we 're going to , and put our journey on , to see what the building blocks of the universe .
now , of course , in a way to stir some of these accidents to the debate to extract value of the science and <unk> , such planetary boundaries . it 's easy , that it .
i think the fact that 's so hard is , the fact that we about our planetary boundaries of the grasp , is perceived value of the things like the lhc .
i 'm going to my final element words , english scientist to their own . humphrey <unk> , the , as i believe , when he the closet experiments , of <unk> defended itself to be a student was michael <unk> , this , `` nothing is that dangerous for the evolution of human spirit , when i assume that our scientific ideas on are that 's no mysteries in nature is that our triumphs <unk> are , and that 's no new worlds to conquer there . ''
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
books used to write is my profession , but it 's natural more than that .
it 's also my big , into my love and fascination .
and i do n't expect that , that ever change is .
but it 's recent something weird in my life and my career on that gave me that has brought to my to this work , to rethink together .
this to unify the incident was that i recently wrote a book , to have -- a biography called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- that , decided to different than all my previous books from that for some in the world in a more and a <unk> , international <unk> .
the result is that i , matter where i come to be treated well let me as if i the sinking of <unk> .
seriously -- the sinking of <unk> !
for instance , they come up very concerned , to me and say , if you are n't you to this success never by be ?
you have no longer afraid of that they all their lives <unk> and never again a book , create that anybody in the world to know ? never again ? ''
okay , this is really the courage .
it would be however , worse , when i do n't remember this would that i 'm in about 20 years , when i was a teenager the first time of them told that i became a writer , wanted to be , with the same kind of <unk> always been faced 'm .
the people said , were you 're not afraid , never succeeded , to have ?
you no fear that you the humiliation of rejection killing ?
you no longer afraid you to this a your life for <unk> and it never heard something that and that you on a <unk> <unk> dreams are going -- your mouth with the bitter dregs of ash into the failure to get ?
so roughly , you know .
the answer -- the short answer on these questions is : <unk>
yes , i 'm afraid of all those things .
and the year i always .
and i ago , a lot more things , that no <unk> would .
like this -- and other <unk> things .

this is about ?
it 's obvious that of someone to be that he of it , the work to do to the it , you get to feel ?
and what exactly the creative , there was going on you to us into uncertainty about the other <unk> do -- in a way , how it other professions have n't do ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i ca , not a situation in its own 40 years as a chemist , remember , in the he was asked , if he afraid to have , chemist .
with your <unk> , john -- how it 's hear you that ?
it was just not , you know ?
but to be fair to be -- the group of the chemist who have over the centuries , not the reputation of <unk> <unk> people get .
we who seem , but these kinds of the reputation . but not just the writer , but the huge dearth of genres , like this call to have mental , it 's unstable .
everything that they need to do , is , the bitter <unk> of really great minds from just the in the 20th century . at the young and a lot of their own hand , died .
and even the ones who do n't actually <unk> <unk> , the tracks of their talents that point was to be .
norman <unk> said in a he died in his last job interview , <unk> my books , i was a little further <unk>
an extraordinary thing that you about her life can do .
but we shrug our n't even if we get that could tell you hear , because we of these statements for so long time to know , somehow we have the african attitude that level and offers accepted that creativity and tired of course <unk> and that art -- the end -- always going to <unk> .
the question , i 'm going to everyone here to ask you want is : is this idea for them completely in order ?
you feel , comfortable with ? because with only one inch by looking at -- i feel with the rejection of all not comfortable .
i think they become really .
and i think they 're dangerous . and i do n't want to watch , the next century , by 2027 .
i think it 's better , if we asked of creative encourage living .
and i know definitely , it for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to be able to start , this dark path of a hunch , <unk> -- especially in the fact , i fell in my career , am .
that means -- you see , i 'm pretty well . i 'm only about . 40 years old .
i may yet another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely likely that everything , what i went from now , going to write the world as the work they will , after the <unk> success of my last book came , right ?
i say it comes straight , because we 're here , yes , all of friends -- it 's most likely to my greatest and behind me .
oh , jesus , which for a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts , who started to you 're going to nine o'clock in all , <unk> to drink . and that i want to do n't .
i 'd prefer to continue this work to do that i love .
so is the question : how ?
eventually , the <unk> seem to me that i had to continue to write down to , of <unk> psychological ones are building design must .
somehow i have to from now to find a way , the can write a safe distance to real disjunction between me and my very natural <unk> about the same reaction , that 's not going to be .
i was in the last year after study models for looking to have the three to do , i also in the past , looking for and i tried to other societies have to find out to see , if you might better or <unk> ideas about it did when we , creative can help , with the emotional risks to deal , with the creativity to them .
this for led me the old greece and the old , rome .
you follow me , because the circle were going to be back to close .
but in ancient greece and rome , people have n't believe that creativity of people , okay ?
they believed that creativity of <unk> <unk> was , from a distant , and unknown source to the people coming -- from <unk> , and unknown things .
the greeks called this kind of <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from socrates is known that it 's believed , he had a <unk> , and wisdom from on the distance , which .
the roman had the same idea , which was that kind of <unk> creative spirit of a <unk> .
this is great . the roman and we were n't really , a genius , a very clever which was .
they believed that a genius with this magical about anything divine , was that we did was that 's literally in the walls of <unk> lives -- about as <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artists in the work of invisible <unk> and the outcome of design would .
that 's brilliant , there is it , there 's the distance , of the i talked about -- the psychological ideas are building , you look at the follow your work to protect .
and everybody knew that it worked , right ?
the artists of the <unk> was a certain things are protected , like , for example , to a lot <unk> , right ?
if your work , brilliant was they were , you 're not all look for you facilities . everybody knew you to this <unk> genius did that you really helpful .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely , your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , your genius , was something <unk> .
so , people have in the west really long time about creativity , while .
and the renaissance and all changed . we had this great idea . and this great idea was : let us the individual attains the center of the universe , imagine -- about all the gods and mystery . and there 's no room , for the unicorn , warmth-requiring creatures , the orders of divinity .
it 's the rational idea of humanism , and the people started to believe that creativity is completely off the own individual needs came .
the first time in history , you hear you people , or measure of artists , a genius call -- instead of that he 's a genius .
i must tell you : i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , one was given person to allow that he thinks , he or she was like that at the pelvis and the essence , and the source of divinity , creative , with unknown , an mystery is a little tiny , too much responsibility to move them a <unk> , human psyche , even more .
it 's how someone to ask , the sun to swallow .
the most disfiguring cancer and distorted by the whole big egos , and it 's all these <unk> expectations of the success .
i think that the <unk> our artists , the last 500 years <unk> .
and , if it is , -- and i think , it 's true -- is the question :
we change ?
maybe to a interventions , understanding of the relationship between humans and the mystery of creative ways to return .
maybe not .
maybe we can that <unk> from 500 years of rational humanistic about it 's in a <unk> talk , the chance .
and there 's certainly affecting people in this audience , really fair , to register , over the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , so forth . how to work .
i 'm probably not all of them on this journey , can take away .
but the question , i left posing want is : why not ?
why not so think about ?
because it as much sense like anything other that i heard of have , if it was never about , absolutely crazy <unk> <unk> the creative process to understand .
a process , -- like everybody knows , it ever tried , something to make -- so in other words , actually , here -- not always as to behave .
in fact , it , sometimes , is literally <unk> feel .
i had recently that sort of what did when i the extraordinary american beat poet , <unk> stone , the well over 90 is , but all their lives for a poet . they told me that you when the <unk> virginia up out the fields and i worked . they said , they would feel and to listen as a poem written about the landscape on them <unk> .
they said it would like a <unk> move from the air ,
the about the country , they <unk> would .
they felt , if it came , because it would the earth , under their feet , <unk> bring .
they knew that they asked in fact that moment , just one could do . and this was -- in her words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran out how the devil , house while you from this poem that was being . it was only about , if you to quickly enough to one of paper and a pen to get to , so they it , if it through them <unk> to capture , and on the sheet , that could .
in another painting was n't you fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they had reached the house , and the poem would weave through them and you missed it . they said it would keep talking about the country to and -- how they said -- <unk> a different compared to <unk> .
and then there 's these moments -- the part i will never forget -- they said that it moments , there in which they it 's almost over missed .
so , she runs to the house and for the paper and the poem , which goes through them and they 're a pen , right when it through them <unk> and then -- i said , you -- it was so when i 'd love with their other hand , we reach and it to get .
you five miles the poem of his tail and moved it back in your body and it 's took on the kind of paper .
in these times that came the poem do and intact , on the paper , -- but it backwards -- from last word for the first .
when i think that i heard , i thought this is one level -- that 's exactly what kind of my creative process <unk>
this is actually ca n't like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel .
i 'm a <unk> . to work to i have to every day , the same time to get up and sweats , i struggle and really pretty uncomfortable <unk> .
but even i held in <unk> 've sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess that many of you that 's also have done .
even i had to work or ideas , from a source of me <unk> , i really do n't identify it .
what is that for a thing ?
and how we step , so in the relationship with no about our minds to lose , but for us the point , even in mental health to do ?
for me is the living for example , this to be the musician , tom <unk> . i had to him a few years for a magazine persons .

but then it became even older and quiet . he told me that he 's one day on a <unk> in going to los angeles went . and there , everything changed for him .
he went with high speed as he suddenly a simple patch of a melody , you hear that , how it in my inspirations are often is , for him <unk> hard is tangible . and he wants you have . you is gorgeous . he <unk> then , but he can you ca n't .
he has not a piece of paper , he has n't a pen , he has no <unk> .
he begins , these old <unk> in him up , like , `` i 'm going to this thing to say , and i 'm coming from this song on forever are .
i 'm not good enough , i do it ''
but rather than in out to get , he heard just stopped .
he ended up all the <unk> and did something completely new .
he looked up just in the sky and said , <unk> , you ca n't see that i car to drive ? ''
<unk> i was so , when i could just a song goes down ?
if you really exist want to come to a <unk> moment , again , when i have to you care about .
if not , <unk> today , someone else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>
be whole <unk> , then we 've changed .
not the work itself . that was still many times as dark time and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> , it around , was salvaged when he was that of a genius , it took , where he 's nothing more than the trouble was making and it , there betrayal , where it , came from . he realized that 's not a skilled behavior , <unk> thing had to be .
it was a strange beasts of being miraculous , bizarre , working there , a conversation and tom , and the alien , <unk> thing that 's not , tom 's been .
when i do this story about this one of have changed it also a bit of the way , i worked and it has made me , even have saved .
this idea that saved me when i in the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> . i fell in one of dug the <unk> in the we all these fall , if we of something to work and it does n't . you <unk> , to think that 's a disaster . this is the worst sketch artist book , that ever was written .
not just bad , but the bottom of all time .
i started to think , i should the project , just <unk> .
but then i remembered it , like tom opens onto the free to heaven i 've had and i tried it .
i was so my view from the manuscript , and spoke to comment , an empty the corner of the room .
i spoke out loud , `` stop , you thing , you and i know them , if this book , not brilliant , this is that 's not completely my fault , is , right ?
because you see , that i do everything that i , <unk> . i 'm not even more than that .
if you get it so much we have you want to have to you here show up and your of the deal , all .
okay . but , if you do n't do -- you know what , to the devil with it .
i 'm and writing , because this is my job .
and i want to go to follow protocol , there that i do today for my part of jobs here raw
because -- the end it 's how to follow . centuries ago , have , in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> with the sacred and music and music around , for a funeral ceremony has been -- to <unk> .
this fixed prices were always been great , because the dancer who were highly professional and they were fantastic .
but , again , very rare , was something special . of the performer is was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know , what i mean , because i know that they all in your life , once that sort of performance , have seen .
it was when i would have the time <unk> and the dancer walks through a doorway to . he did n't something different than he 's ever before has done -- spends 1,000 nights earlier . but all the added , together .
and very suddenly appeared he 's not anymore , no longer in human .
he was from up and of the bottom up and everything is lit up , through a divine , fire .
when that at that happened to know the people what was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , <unk>
this is god , you know ?
some of historical footnote : when the <unk> <unk> cetaceans they brought this centuries-old practice . the way it changed , over the centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that you still in <unk> and <unk> hear .
if a performer , in spain a <unk> , something magic has done , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> the brain , there is it , a glimpse at the god .
and that 's amazing , because we need that .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , if the dancer from themselves up and see that 's 11 o'clock , a tuesday , is -- and he did n't no longer a <unk> of god in , wearing .
he is merely a premature aging mortal self with <unk> at . and maybe he will never again to these heights , it .
and perhaps will never again , god 's name out , when he said , about . but what is he then with the rest of his life begin ?
that 's hard .
this is one of <unk> done some of creative life .
but maybe it must not , so , and the anguish , if you in the first , we did n't have to the most critical aspects of being , of you move it .
if you might just think that you a loaner are -- from an export source for a <unk> time your life that , somebody else 's being passed , if you 've done it .
if we start , that 's going to think it changes all this .
so i started to think , and so i think , certainly in the past few months , while i 'm going to the book working , that soon be going -- as the dangerous to appetite , and i expected <unk> my <unk> success .
what i always , even need to say , when i talk about this crazy , let me , is : i did n't afraid .
do n't be feeling disheartened .
just do your job .
she was going to continue for your contribution , what that he may be .
when your job that dance is , i 'm dancing .
if the dumb divine genius , that you the side of really is to decide , for a moment , yet from the miracles through your effort to show , <unk> ! ''
and if not , i 'm dancing and yet , your dance .
and <unk> ! '' for you , despite all this .
i believe it . and i feel that we should be the teaching .
<unk> ! '' for you , despite all this , just for you to the mere human universal love and the <unk> in precisely , that there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i have these slides just shown to illustrate that the arctic <unk> , for some way , three million years of the size of the bottom of 48 states had to 40 percent down .
but that there 's not too strong enough to the seriousness , this particular problem , there 's not the thickness of the ice is the world .
in a sense , is the arctic <unk> that beating heart of our global <unk> .
they grow in winter and -- in summer .
the next slide that i do you 'll show that 's a <unk> what in the last 25 years happened .
that <unk> , it 's making a .
as you see , it 's on the blue is to . this is the year by ice in the wintertime ; and it -- in summer .
that 's called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which of the body , here <unk> .
in 25 years , it from here , here 's gone .
this is a problem , because the warming the frozen reason the arctic ocean <unk> , it , very large amounts of <unk> carbon out there , which , when he <unk> , of microbes , methane , which is .
comparing with the entire amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , could , this will double , if we 've got this critical point that cross .
already today <unk> in a flat , lakes in alaska , methane itself from the water .
professor <unk> walter , the university in alaska , of another task force to another one shallow seas in the last winter , across .
wow !
she 's good . the question is , how would have to us through .
and a reason is , this enormous amount of heat up with the greenland from the north .
this is a year <unk> .
but the volume , are much bigger than ever .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know how the heavens through <unk> up here <unk> you the ocean .
those rivers , rapid pace .
the other end of the planet , and antarctica , the largest mass on the planet .
last month had signed up , researchers that the entire continent now a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , about a couple <unk> up is that 's very strong in the melting .
this is 20 feet above sea level , greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> mass , you see the top of lakes , a few years of glaciers were .
40 percent of people on the world get the half of their <unk> of this draining down .
in the andes , is this glacier , the <unk> for this town .
the as well have , <unk> .
but if you <unk> , will also the most of water <unk> .
in california was a 40 percent reduction in <unk> the sierra seen .
this in the <unk> .
and the predictions , you read have , are seriously .
this <unk> in the whole world that leads to a dramatic increase of fire .
and the challenger disaster in the world have in a really <unk> and she 'd never an unprecedented degree gained .
times as many in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you this in the historical context of yourself , you can see , what it <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced at all of 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
you look , the area of the eastern pacific , right , from the continent the west and both the indian <unk> , where it 's a drastically decline of oxygen in the ocean there .
the largest single factor for the global warming , deforestation , which is 20 percent , which is the burning of fossil fuels .
it 's a problem , and coal is that 's nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are one or the largest <unk> , along with china .
and the suggestion was , many more <unk> to build .
but we start , a change .
here are the , in recent years , painted by , with some green are alternatives , and proposed by .
<unk> there 's a political engagement in in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent to clean coal to apply , which is , if you have a contradiction in , is .
this reminded me of something .
the christmas around them off , with me to home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> .
they have it <unk> in the news .
this is in our whole country in the <unk> can promote america .
this happened to the christmas .
one of the commercials , <unk> the christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy -- .
it 's in the shell and wealth in america , and he helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> going to every day , clean .
he is affordable , and <unk> , and the workers will remain in wages , and this bread .
this is the source of the most of coal in west virginia .
the most <unk> is the heads of massey coal .
, let me a very clear to say , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry author , they do n't know , what they talk .
so , the alliance for <unk> two leaders will be in in '' .
this is one , a part of her .
in the <unk> we see the climate change , as a serious at risk for our business .
so we have it gives us to the top <unk> to actually , a significant <unk> spending to a <unk> on the way to the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is not much .
we think , she 's clean -- and it 's also still good .
so , to do n't worry about the climate .
let them the quiet for us .
<unk> coal , they have a lot about it .
so you make us a tour of modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal of the main reasons for the global warming is , the remarkably , clean <unk> , you see here , changes everything .
you look , it right , this is the world today , clean <unk> .
finally grew up , the positive is -- with our economic challenge and our challenge the national security .
america 's in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the major thread , these all together , is our dependence of <unk> <unk> like the dirty and coal and <unk> oil .
but now there 's a bold , new solutions to us from this <unk> able to be free .
<unk> america with 100 percent cleaner , electricity to say , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america , back to work to bring to us safer place to try and to help , the global warming continues to stop .
finally , a solution that 's large enough , our to solve problems .
<unk> america in new . they get more out .
this is the last thing .
it goes to a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest way , our dependence of the old , dirty diapers <unk> , our world , one , to reduce .
the future is here . wind , the sun and a new energy system .
new investments to evaluate all came from well-paid jobs of law .
<unk> america in new . it 's time , reality to embrace .
there 's an old african saying : `` if you be fast you want to go alone .
if you very far come you want to go together . ''
we need to go far come , quickly .
thank you .
i want to begin to ask them , the time your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> played .
while they realized how to the hands out and <unk> , the <unk> pick up and moves , they learned in fact , to think , and problems through the understanding and change the spatial what 's going to solve .
the spatial can think is so closely connected spaces , we have a lot of our environment .
as a scientist -- inspired by the kind of our interaction with real word objects -- and with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , i began to be wondering : what would , if we use computers were , instead of <unk> , as a digital <unk> on a flat tie these moves -- what would , if we do with both hands were could and data , physically , who and they so the way we could , how we do it want ?
this question was so really , that we need to study of the answer is going on and <unk> developed .
in short , a <unk> is a more interactive computer in the size of <unk> .
you can with the hand may be moved , you can , each other as well , you can her explore motion capture and they have a screen and a <unk> .
more importantly , they 're physically , why you like blocks are merely by the stick out of hands and access to move .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools <unk> , and a consciousness for your movement to develop , to recognize and the intricacies of our <unk> with you see , then we can share with the study of new and <unk> <unk> start .
i 'll begin with some simple example .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i asked him in a direction <unk> , the video . move it ; if i asked him in the other <unk> , there 's now it backwards .
and this interactive for portraits , here , becomes true .
if i do you so next to peel , and that their interest .
if you <unk> are surrounded , we realize you that , and able to a little nervous .
and they feel as their movements and slope .
an interesting a result of interactions , we 're going to see it started , was that we keep everyday gestures on the data to be , as color so to them into how to this with <unk> does .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can use them to paint in the in the center to pour , then mixed up .
if we do it carried , we can get a little <unk> .

i 'm here -- that 's a fibonacci numbers , i went with a simple <unk> draw .
this is a game with words , that sort of a mixture of <unk> and <unk> is .
basically , you make each round , every <unk> to <unk> letters and while you 're trying to modify words to form , this talk about a dictionary went through .
then , after about 30 seconds , is back up and you has a new <unk> and new ways to try .
thank you .
that are some kids , is a trip to the media lab , came out . i could you to move , it to try and have a video of them .
they have it really loved .
a more interesting fact , of applications is that you to the people not a lot of instructions , there must .
everything else you need to say is `` it used words , '' and you know exactly what to do .
here are still a few people that 's test .
this is our youngest <unk> down there right .
it turned out , he said to the <unk> just a pile .
so for him , they were just blocks .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we want a own for <unk> develop .
this is <unk> .
he can create new characters in the scene , to , by it 's the <unk> the picture on top , this figure shows .
here it 's the sun is an instantaneous .
the sun goes on
now speeding up he 's a <unk> in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good job ! yeah !
and he the <unk> shake and them , put it could , the characters are so ...
i brought his own story unto ourselves .
hello !
it 's a story with open up and he can decide , how do these illnesses .
flying his cat .
the last example , for that i now time , to have , it to show that 's a <unk> for <unk> , that recently we 've developed and in the <unk> as a wide , like <unk> , singing and the drums , operate .
each has four different variations on ; you can choose , which you to use .
and you can this sounds in the sequence -- that you again in any of them .
and you <unk> you , by showing you just a <unk> to a <unk> holding .
there are the effects that you live , we can change , like . hall and filter .
you connect him with a particular sound , and one from him and then to hire .
and then , the overarching effects , like the speed and the volume , you on the entire sequence , well .
so let me .
we start , we the <unk> in two <unk> -- and this in a series of them , they expand and a little bit more about the voice to add .
now in -- i have a bass , it .
now i 'm still a play drums .
and now speeding up , i the filters out with the drums , so i the effect on the control .
i can the entire sequence of the speed , by now , at the one or other direction <unk> .
and now speeding up , i the filter , with the bass ; for something more expression .

so i have to do n't you in the reservations are planning , but you truly improvising ; they meanwhile extend or the inhabitants up .
and finally , i can the entire sequence <unk> , by , i <unk> , left we tend to .
thank you .
so as you can see , is my desire to think it , new <unk> to the better to fit , how our brains and body work .
and today , i had time , you a part of these new <unk> and some of possibilities of going to what we in our lab to work .
the thought , i them with the want to leave , is that we 're going to the threshold to this new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media are , the information in our world to bring that our needs to .
thank you ,
i 'm on the conversations with you all !
