when steve lopez , funny the los angeles times , one day through the streets of the center of los angeles , i was he heard it 's a music .
they came from a man , an african-american , how likable , notoriously rough , are homeless , on a violin and playing , the only thing to two strings .
many of you 're going to the story that you know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , think of this movie was , with robert <unk> junior , when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> school , and by promising was tragically the early by your paranoid schizophrenia , was ended .
nathaniel left the master , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later when he was homeless man on the streets of <unk> row in the center of los angeles .
i 'm going to everybody , <unk> book to read or at the film and watch , and so you 're not just the wonderful connected to understand that between these two men 's happened is , but what the music , this compound one day -- and how they finally , this instrument was , if this pun , which allows is that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get .
i met this mr <unk> in 2008 , two years ago , walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a demo of <unk> first , and fourth symphony of yours and i got behind the stage , around me to imagine .
he was in a very <unk> and social sound over the yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and of how the dodgers abandoned it 's ever in the kid world series of work would . and that it all the <unk> passage of the first violin at the last sentence of <unk> fourth symphony .
we went from the subject of music to talk . and a few days later i get an email , in the state that nathaniel , for <unk> at my interest .
i have to mention that nathaniel a medical <unk> , because he was stacked with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> been treated , a trauma , that his entire life -- there .
a number of it is now , especially vulnerable is that electroconvulsive stages . who are sometimes that bad , and he days away , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , always on horror and the <unk> his own mind 's exposed .
and in just as a <unk> ended up nathaniel , let the first to class , walt disney <unk> hall were beginning . he had this wrong , the flickering in his eyes and almost seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible , demons and smoke and of how i did anyone in my sleep poison you want to .
i was afraid , not donated , but i was afraid that i assessed him lose the way that it in your mental states , sinking could , and that i was to use your relationship to a violin destroying it could , when i started , about <unk> and <unk> and other interesting shape the <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started it 's just about to play .
i was playing the first sentence of <unk> <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed at that in <unk> eyes a full of change before they went .
it was , as if it under the impact of an invisible drugs and it said , a chemical response , which is a catalyst of my game was .
<unk> <unk> anger turns into understanding , in a calm curiosity and such unbending grace .
and the way through a miracle that he took his violin and started , for people , some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , them out to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started to go on , about music to talk , starting from the stream through a beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other protocell b , of <unk> , right up to <unk> <unk> .
and made me realize that he 's not just a <unk> know about music owned , but it with her a narrow porthole of personal relationship you connected .
he talked about her gums with a passion and an understanding that i would n't just by my colleagues in the philharmonic , from los angeles to know .
by his music playing and about music , talking , was from this <unk> , confused man , just go through the streets of los angeles , who was , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the master <unk> musicians to become .
music is medicine . music is changing ourselves .
for nathaniel means that music <unk> health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and intractable delusions with his imagination and creativity in a real <unk> .
and so <unk> his <unk> situation .
i realized that kind of the essence of art is .
what this is the reason that we want to do : so we do something that in all of us , deep in which is , our feelings , by our artistic lens , through our creativity to actually shape .
and the fact that expression being hit us , and moves , inspired , and that unites us .
what nathaniel <unk> , so i took him the music back into a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music took him back into a family of musicians , the inside your mind that might be a talent and i went to and raised hands .
and i 'm going to the time with nathaniel music , no matter whether the case , walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me about , why i musicians to become really am .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i 'd rather play , that i <unk> the <unk> stolen have .
i hope you pardon me .
so i have in my life , many other known .
i 've only two loved .
this first , this was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a nice store fish , <unk> good , it , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what a fish .
even better , he was in <unk> after the walk across the top of standards of sustainability from .
you could be so comfortable with a way to him to sell it .
i had the beauty of a relationship with about several months .
one day , called the head of the company , and said , if i was an event to tell you might look over the sustainability in the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
there was a company , the to solve was trying to do this tremendous problem for chefs 's gone . how to keep that we fish on our menus ?
in the last 50 years , we have the sea fish , how to forests <unk> did have .
it 's hard to the destruction of <unk> .
90 percent of the big fish , that we love of tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , this swordfish , they have collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so i will probably disney or not <unk> , <unk> , a piece of our future .
many of arguments against . <unk> pollute the environment , the most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take these tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds <unk> are required to make a pound <unk> get .
so not sustainable .
theyâ€™re not very good .
so here was finally one company , who was trying to be able to do .
i wanted you support .
the day before the event , i called the head of <unk> for the company .
we call him , don .
`` don '' , i said , `` just about the facts were able to have , you are famous for , so far out in the sea , to grow , that you like the environment is not an aquifer . ''
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out that the waste from a fish out is , not paying attention . ''
and then on it on top , `` we 're essentially a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one of what ? what program where you ? ''
`` how sustainable proteins , '' he said .
`` great '' , i said , put on .
and at that night , i was in bed and i thought , what the hell 's a sustainable protein that ?
so i called the next day , just before the event , don .
i said , don , what for example are sustainable and proteins that ? ''
he said , he had her n't . he 'll ask folks .
now , i get on with a few people in the company . nobody could join me a cash for the answer . to give up until i finally , with senior fellow biologists on .
we call him as well , don .
`` don '' , i said , `` what for example are sustainable and proteins that ? ''
now , he said , some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , the plume of skin , <unk> , redwood rainforests , <unk> and to feed to process . ''
i said , `` how much percent of you consume it 's chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well that are about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don , which is too strongly remember , grilled chicken at the fish to feed ? ''
there was a long break in the leadership , and he said , `` there 's just too much chicken in the world . ''
i <unk> me about this fish .
no , not , because i 'm a <unk> <unk> and <unk> am .
this is me , even .
no , i <unk> actually from the fish <unk> , because , i swear on god , the fish in this entertainment , for chicken , kept .
this second fish , that 's a different kind of year-old .
it 's the romantic sort of the kind of the work with you , ever better if you put his fish that you know that we learn , you the fish in the more love .
i told him first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
a <unk> journalist who had been thinking about this fish , spoke .
they got us kind of the <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost glowing in the white color .
the chef who did <unk> .
you know , twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can a fish and so well , tasted the people have , after he <unk> here ?
i ca n't it , but this guy can it .
we call him miguel sokoloff . actually means he miguel sokoloff .
and no , he has the fish no , cooked , and he 's not a chef . at least on the kind of them and i have to understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
she 's near the <unk> of the river <unk> .
so far in the thing i was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they 're domesticated <unk> on , which basically the wetlands out .
they made that through them to the country <unk> .
they built this complicated series of sewers , and they had urged her water from land out and beyond the river .
well , they could n't make that was working , not benefiting economically .
and what it was a catastrophe .
it was roughly 90 percent of the birds in order , which for this place , many birds are .
and so in the old 1982 , a spanish company with green bought that land .
what they 're doing ?
they have the river of water in reverse .
they 've literally the dials <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> they brought the channels to the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a thousand of acres <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , the shrimp , eel that -- and have miguel , and his company in the environmental destruction all through reverse .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , you have something like never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , a million miles away is , and all they 're seeing <unk> channels and this submerged naturally , lush march .
i was there was n't long time with miguel sokoloff .
he 's an guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part `` a crocodile , kissing . ''
okay ? there we were , fought alongside us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , i have on dirt to my knees , and miguel holding in peace one <unk> .
here , out , he 's a rare <unk> out .
now i said he the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , here 's a pattern of the pool , that it on the <unk> giraffe .
it turns out that is miguel the most of his career in <unk> national park in africa has spent .
i asked him , like him to such a <unk> 's gone .
he said , fish ? i know nothing about the fish .
i 'm an expert , for connection . ''
and then he leaves , and sudden plummets , in any instant of those rare in the birds and algae and weird <unk> .

it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak about this <unk> piece here 's a fish , that i went around the brink of .
so i 've been . i said , `` miguel , how it comes to be your fish and so well , taste ? ''
he showed up the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , it 's unbelievable .
but what 's built-in fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , he goes on me to tell that 's such a rich system is that the fishes better food , what you in the wilderness of food they would .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , that 's what the fish program .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
it 's no food .
one of a farm heard of their animals not an ?
later , the day i went on this site to miguel around and i asked him , i said , for a place , the way of course it seems to be , '' different from each ant farm , the i ever had been , `` how to measure , you are succeeding ? ''
in the moment , it was , as if a <unk> a <unk> actually have .
and we got around the corner and we provided by the most incredible picture of thousands and pinker flamingos , a literally , pinker carpet and so far from the eye can see .
`` it 's success , '' he said .
`` look upon you their bellies on , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was very disturbed man .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> they 're not your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we 're lost 20 percent of our fish and <unk> at the birds .
now , last year we were on this site 600,000 , birds , more than 100 different types .
it is the largest and one of the major commercial <unk> in across europe has gone .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last , that you on a <unk> have to ? ''
he 's going around his head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> , not hard .
this is a arndt , a network .
the flamingos , and eat the shrimp .
the shrimp , and eat the phytoplankton .
ever , pinker 's the belly of the less than making this system . ''
okay , let 's see that has come . a farm , the way they were not an and a farm , the their success on the health of its predators on measuring .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way we should those flamingos covered by the first place , not even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the and moved better is the <unk> .
every morning to fly them to 240 kilometers to farm .
and every night around and they are 240 miles back .
they do that because they the <unk> white line the highway <unk> follow .
seriously .
i had a kind of travel throughout the penguins , so i looked miguel sokoloff .
i said , `` miguel , fly them to 240 kilometers to the farm and fly you go back up 240 miles back at night ?
do it for the children ? ''
he looked at me , i 've just a song of the whitney , and houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they do that because the food is better . ''
i 'm not the skin of my beloved fish and said , the most delicious was , and i do n't like <unk> . i ca n't you <unk> . i ca n't you <unk> .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i 'm cooking , almost never seen it .
and yet , when i do in this restaurant in <unk> attempted 've got you do n't go <unk> kept .
they she 's sweet and change course , as if you a half bites , from taking it .
i mentioned that they face is miguel , and he take naps every time .
he said , `` the skin , like a sponge .
she 's the last somewhat , until something in the body to entry .
she has over the evolution has evolved to <unk> suck . ''
and then on it on top , but our drinking water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , the your fish do n't program . a farm , the their success is the success of its predators .
and then i realized , if he says , a farm , the no <unk> has to <unk> he 's powerful , because the water , this is through this farm , which comes from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , all the things to it leads , by those rivers are now to pitch , you to be able to lead , chemical pollutants , flow of <unk> .
and if it around in the system , fought you have , and this leaves is the water cleaner , how it <unk> is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans water is .
so not just a farm , the way they were not an , not just a farm , the their success on the health services to do some measure , but a farm , who literally a <unk> is , and not only for these fish , but for you and me .
because if it <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take him , and that they should also do , because those six year-old , like one-on-one is whatever , is also telling .
you might argue that she 's a recipe is the future of good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what we now we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture , the orange , in the foods really good to taste .
but for many people 's a little bit of radical .
we 're not <unk> , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love this little <unk> . we talk about local food . we eat the organic .
and if they claim that the things are the future of good food can assure everybody 's somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey guys , i love the pink flamingos , but how they become the world to feed ?
how they become the world to feed ? ''
can i be honest ?
i like this question .
no , not , because we have enough of calories are producing to the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are today hungry .
one billion -- this is more than ever -- because <unk> inequalities that in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question , not because they the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years about activities .
feed the grain of <unk> , <unk> at monocultures , chemicals in the earth , grilled chicken at the fish , and all the time has of agribusiness , just wondered : `` if we more people 's cheaper to feed , how awful it 's true ? ''
this was the motivation . it was the treat it . it was the plan , the american agriculture .
we should they say , what she is , a really compiling data in <unk> , a really compiling the fast arndt , of its , that 's exactly this production of this .
this is not really compiling , and it 's not invent agriculture .
our <unk> is today , not because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , it by a fertile one country , not by the pumps , but through fresh water , not with chainsaws programmatically , it by the forests , and not by were and nets , it by the fish in the ocean .
they like the world to feed ?
they let us to start with the question : how we going to feed ?
or better , how we can help conditions do that every community , enabling to yourself to feed ?
in order to do this , you looking not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and ever-faster machines are at <unk> and it has never heard something really good for food produced .
let me to the ecological systems model .

you look miguel , farmers how is miguel ,
people inhabit that do n't worlds for themselves are , businesses that restore levels of <unk> , businesses , the <unk> grow , rather than just hard to farmers , are not just gases are , but experts , for connection ,
because they are the ones who also hired experts speak for the flavor .
and when i really honestly , i 'm sure you 're a better , chef : when i do it ever be going .
so you know that 's my right , because if that the future of good food is , it delicious .
thank you .
if i do you today , one of creatures wants it is that the totality of data that we consume it 's bigger than the sum of its parts and instead of the <unk> to think i 'd like that you think about how we information that can use that , patterns start and we kind of trends , you realize that otherwise , not visible to become less .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> after the age , arranged .
this program , that i 'm going to use , is a little experiment .
it means <unk> and what i do with <unk> can do this is that i after a certain death will filter is able to say we are accidents .
and instantly i see a different patterns that they yield .
and now , because in <unk> here , people at <unk> are and you over here at <unk> .
we can one more step out and sort of data from then , and see that <unk> and cancer in the usual suspects , are , but not for everyone .
so if we go and after the age <unk> , we say , 40 years or a younger , we see that are accidents , even the cause is about the people 's really ought to do .
and who <unk> see that 's this particular , men in true .
you see so that 's look of information and data in this way through lots of swimming in a living <unk> .
and if we do this is raw data can make , why not too much for the content matters ?
what we now have here are the front covers , every single , sport <unk> '' that ever actually been .
it 's all over here . it 's everything online .
you can it like to go on giving in their rooms and test .
with <unk> you can jump into a decade .
you can jump into a particular year .
you can actually attached to a given an issue forward .
now if i 'm looking , i see the athlete that in this issue comes up and the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so i click over time to me all expenses that show where lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , when i just a <unk> so we want to be that i think , `` ok , what if i woke up with the subject of walking , i look ? ''
so i leave me step back and <unk> of view .
now i see , greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of that if you that way information scans , specifically , broadly , <unk> , <unk> , then over that you know , or <unk> not just .
you do something that actually a little differently .
it 's something between , and we think it changes the way , and the way that information can be used .
i 'd like this idea now a little more to do with about what a little crazed .
what we 've done is , we have every single <unk> taken and you on a little summary , reduced .
the summary , which includes a short , often , and a symbol of the realm of them coming .
i 'm just take the top five centuries of the most popular <unk> .
but even in this appears with that we have a lot of things .
once we get a sense across the themes that at wikipedia , most popular .
i 'll discuss this topic <unk> '' vote .
now , after i <unk> ' 've taken know what i feel that the <unk> of the most likely to meet at times magazine , `` people of the year . ''
this is really important , because this one thing is that 's not in a single <unk> there .
this is just to see if you one step back and this whole minds .
overlooking a certain that <unk> i can go into the issue of times magazine , `` people of the year , '' go , and all see .
now if i all these people consider you know what i feel that the majority of <unk> . some people come out of science . some , less again , come from the economy . it 's my head . and one comes from <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's a ted prize winner .
so we can now fast forward and a look at all the ted prize winner of downsides .
you see , we 're getting on the first time this as if it also really a net is , not just by side to , but as much more abstractly .
and so i want you what else out what a little surprise could be .
i 'll show you is just the new york times website .
<unk> , this app -- i want it 's not a browser and do ; it 's not a browser , but you can do web , to look -- and we bring these <unk> to every single one website , like this .
so i can one step back , and directly to a specific <unk> jump .
this is why most important , because you just through that look at the web in these kinds and the way , all the <unk> on the same type and it 's how much as possible .
so i can in my trajectory zoom in a certain <unk> .
here is the state of all the demonstration , that i ended up here , we 've given .
and i can sort everything , what i 'd been deemed done , back .
and , when i do another one step managed and at all look , can i do some of them in order , maybe for my <unk> . here , i went <unk> ' said , here . and bing , right here to live from labs <unk> .
and from here i can in the side to go and they went back up .
it 's a metaphor , the time , being used , and every time it doing this picture than the sum of the pieces .
the moment , in this world , we think that data a curse .
we talk from , cursing the <unk> .
we talk from `` from drowning in information . ''
what if we this situation around you could and the internet on its head to ask , so that we 're always a money to the other to go to start by many things too many things go to be able , and it creates pattern recognition , what otherwise , hidden behind them all right ?
if we do this can do , it 's then these amplifying feedbacks <unk> , maybe a new source of sense of information .
and , instead , just in information to move , we know it to get .
and if we know , experienced , then we can maybe even the wisdom from moving .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with an <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went to the bus to school , every day an hour at the route .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , that my mind in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> way that i feel deep in me sitting , voracious , curiosity satisfied .
this curiosity that turns out of course , that i always , when i 'm not in school was , through the forests <unk> , walking and `` samples . '' which collected , frogs and snakes and the beetle , and <unk> , all go back and under the microscope was thinking .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was doing is always around the trial , the world to understand and the planetary boundaries of explore .
and my love to science fiction , it seemed to be in my next picture , because the time , in the late '60s , we went to the moon and explore the deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came in our living with his amazing . shows that we animals and places and a world of wonders they showed that we 've never would you can imagine .
this has got comfortable just fine to the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's no video yet these <unk> with computer-generated performance of , you 'll all the imagery in the media , there , i had to the images in my head around .
that we had at all . if we as children 's a book read , we took the description of the author and projected that they look at the screen in our minds .
my response to that was that sketching and paint by aliens , alien world , robots , the spacecrafts , and all so what .
in class , i kept on the teachers get it , like me , below the textbook was hidden , <unk> .
the creativity to know , sort out .
and then there is something interesting . what i 'm going on jacques <unk> they were intrigued , was the idea of a us to be completely unseen world here on our planet itself .
certainly would know i never an alien world with a spacecraft to achieve . this seemed to me very unlikely .
but there was a world that i actually enter it could , here on earth , and she was also fascinating and more exotic as all this , what i always imagined was , when i those books , which , i had .
so i decided , when i was 15 , underwater habitats being .
the only problem with it was that i 'm going to a small village in canada , living , 1,000 kilometers from the oceans getting away .
well let me , but not <unk> .
i have been bugging my father , until he had a <unk> in the shittiest climate , new york , to detect how did , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i 'm doing a <unk> in a pool of <unk> out in winter , in the shittiest climate , new york .
the ocean , but , a real conservation , i received only two years later to face , when we in california , moved .
since , in the 40 years , the meantime <unk> are , i spent about to 10,000 hours in water spent . five hours of them in <unk> .
and i 've learned that the world of the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich in <unk> life is so , so let 's really hardly anyone can imagine .
the imagination , the nature has no boundary quite the contrary to our own , <unk> human imagination .
to present day to me just utter awe , for this , what i have on my early dives , i see .
and my love to the ocean 's holding on , with the same intensity as they said , and ever .
when i then as adults a profession <unk> , it was the <unk> .
this seemed the way , my inner drive , stories to tell , with my desire , images to create , to unite .
when he drew me constantly comic books .
so these films , the way , images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
now , we were the stories that i <unk> , from the science fiction , `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
in `` <unk> '' i could my preference for the <unk> and that comes along with <unk> together .
so intertwined when they 're kind of my two passions .
something interesting happened with `` <unk> '' : a <unk> problem in this video to solve -- and that we had this kind of liquid <unk> create -- to know , we 're on a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what came up with , was the first a computer-generated <unk> , who ever in a film to see .
the movie which is what 's no money one , exactly what did he just hit his caused by a , but i realized something fascinating , this audience around the world was like to be mesmerized by the magic of them forward .
according to arthur clarke 's law 're going to find <unk> technology and magic is no longer have evolved to distinguish kin .
they were so something magic .
and that i found it 's incredibly exciting .
and then i thought , `` wow , it has certainly did in the cinematic be involved . ''
so we go in `` the terminator , two , '' my next movie , even more on .
together with <unk> translations , we were the types of liquid metal . the success was hanging out from , like this effect one with dignity .
and it worked . again , we had something magic is created . and the effect in the audience was the same . however , we have to the movie ever been a little bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences from that , was a whole world now , like a whole world of creativity is <unk> .
so i founded a company , together with my good friend with stan winston to the at the best <unk> and <unk> was . she was called the digital <unk> . ''
the idea of this company was it , the phase , analogous processes with the visual printers etc . to skip ahead and the same with digital <unk> to start .
that we did , and <unk> us as a while a competitive advantage .
but the '90s years we realized that we have something that we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , yes , actually started to the time -- too slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` computational avatar . '' written , that the <unk> in some visual effects and <unk> effects in the whole new heights , we say it should , and he looks realistic about human , expressive characters , the using <unk> been produced was . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world to <unk> be .
but the <unk> put stuff back . and people in my company , said , that we <unk> not yet the capacity to say , that to create .
so , shifted to and made this other film about the big ship , that goes down .
the <unk> i have this as `` romeo and juliet on a ship . '' he sells . it was a <unk> epic <unk> , a passionate film .
those secretly , but i was really to go up the titanic to immerse ourselves .
why i put the movie .
this is the truth . the studio , i knew that is not .
i got them , but i believe , by i said , `` we come to the cover up . we watch the real up .
we get it in the <unk> of the movie , and others .

and i <unk> you , an expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that goes back on it back , that your own imagination a reality we could do .
we then created in fact , six months later a reality , i 'm in russian <unk> found herself , four kilometers in the surface of the north atlantic , and i think about the real titanic , through a <unk> understanding .
this was no movie , not definition , that was so .
so , that i really got away .
and the preparation you 'll have been tremendously . we had given cameras and a spotlight , and all sorts of building .
and i fell on , how much of these <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you 're going up in that cramped capsule , which you in this dark , hostile environment , down , where no hope to rescue , is , when you do n't it yourself back to create .
and then i thought , `` wow , that 's just as well , as if i 'm in <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was really obsessed by studying the deep ocean .
anyway , the piece of this with curiosity and science to do . it was it . it was an adventure , it was a curiosity . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience that i from hollywood to do n't be able to .
because , you know , i was able to me a way to imagine , for that we then a visual on the place could . but i could n't tell me that we 've got the outside of the window would see .
some , the following expeditions we 've been being in <unk> seen , and sometimes these things that i never seen before i had , even sometimes these things that the only have n't seen previously had and for that science to the time , when we do you saw , yet , no words 'd found .
that i 've been so really transformative , and i wanted more .
and so i got a particular decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i told myself , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood to ice breaks down and i 'm going for a while <unk> . ''

we returned to cover up the titanic back .
we took a little robot that we built up , that have a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and at the inside of the ship can look at what we 've ever been done was .
nobody had ever that inside of <unk> demands . you 'd still no means that . so we have developed the first technology .
well , and there for me sit well , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> of these <unk> 's pretty similar , and of which i know that once the band , they did .
and i was flying along with a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i so if it 's just really , but my mind is inside the vehicle .
it felt , as if i spaces inside the <unk> the titanic and there .
that was the <unk> form of a <unk> that i ever have experienced , because before i each about a corner of the minibus where , i knew i always , what a moment in <unk> of the vehicle that appear like , because i conducted months of getting <unk> trial had , when we the film did .
this is set was an exact replica of design plans of the ship .
so that was a very strange and experience .
they made me this <unk> that what you that <unk> avatars or running and so that own consciousness in the car , in these different shape the big shift can .
it was really quite profound
and maybe even a small way that , what perhaps in a few decades might happen , if you <unk> has to something to explore , or other things to do , in all sorts <unk> <unk> that i was <unk> can imagine .
for these kinds of expeditions we started this , what we get down there 'd seen , really appreciate to learn , for example , these <unk> , where we these incredible and shares the animals , saw . that are sort of the aliens , but here on earth .
they live to help of chemosynthesis .
they are not in a way to give them based system , how we do that .
and so you see animals , the next to a 300 degrees , we call that you survive there .
the same time was interesting , i also very much for <unk> , that was once in the <unk> from my childhood .

this was fascinating .
but the end , it was looking beyond that i <unk> with us in the deep back .
i took them with and <unk> you access to the world 's going on , <unk> , <unk> , of people to be for such extreme conditions were . i took them to the sources to , so you look around , where we take and instruments come back and so forth .
we turned out documentaries no , powered , but actually science , specifically , i said , <unk> .
so effectively lock into the circle between my existence as <unk> , then as a kid , and the globe in the reality .
in over these landscapes as i have a lot of learning .
i have a lot about science has taught me . but i think , you probably , a director and also have to be able to a leader be like a <unk> or other .
i understood , but not a lot of leadership , before i this ocean expeditions <unk> .
because of a particular point i had to tell me , `` what do i 'm here ?
why i do it ? what comes out ? ''
these stinking movies are taking us no money .
we 're just look at the caused by a . of fame and they have no .
all think , i was between the `` titanic '' and `` computational avatar . '' <unk> and i 'd let me some level of nails -- on one towel on the <unk> .
i 've all these films , these documentaries no , for a very small audience .
no place , not honor , no money . what you doing that ?
you 're doing it to the task will to the challenge will -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment that there . you 're doing it of <unk> because , and because of funny connection , the building , if a small group of people a team , forming .
because we have all of the only 10 or 12 people made of years , there have partnered with . sometimes we were two or three months row , at sea .
and in this community , you see that the most important thing the warning â€” is that you 're going to each has , because you a task does it does that you any other things can explain .
if you on land back and they say , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and that all around , the whole technology , and the trouble , the <unk> , if you look at sea , work , '' then you can this did n't understand . this is the police or with soldiers , the things together we have gone through and you know that she 's never can explain .
there 's becoming a connection , one of each other respect .
when i go back to my next film `` computational avatar . '' to turn , i tried to the same attends to apply this thing , that you his team have respected and they 're in terms of respect , deserves .
it was the dynamism of really changed .
because i stood so again with a small team up with unknown terrain . we did that , `` computational avatar . '' with a new technique that it was n't yet there .
it 's incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of four years of the family .
and because they changed my kind of films to do , completely .
there were people , who said , we have these <unk> yes , really good <unk> and the planet pandora 's used to go .
for me was it 's a <unk> kind of my job to do , the actual process , in the result has changed .
what we can go from all of finish ?
what the lessons we learned ?
i think , at the first place that 's the curiosity .
it 's the most human quality .
our imagination is a force that even a reality we could do .
and the be aware of your team is important than all <unk> this world .
come to me a young , filmmaker , who say , you give you me a council , as i thought that can do . ''
and i say , `` <unk> , do n't even a .
that they 've been for you . do n't it 's even in fact , i 'll do n't get yourself . but to take risks on you . ''
the nasa has lifted such a <unk> , `` no matter is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and when it seems to fail as an alternative to be , because i guarantee it 's a leap .
no big endeavor , this innovation called for , was ever done without risk being addressed .
you must be willing to these risks on to take .
that 's the idea , the i 'm happy to the journey , want . failure is quite an alternative , fear but it 's no . thanks .
now i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and that 's getting into something that , because my <unk> at the foundation , mainly about the vaccines , and seed is turning to the things that we make up , and deliver need to the poorest two billion a better life to enable .
but energy and varied climates are extremely important for these people , in fact , even more than for each other on planet .
<unk> that means that <unk> over many years , not will grow . it we too much or good enough to rain . the things will be like to change , how it their fragile environment is not withstand that can .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to the uncertainty . it leads to communal unrest .
so , is a climate change , and horrible for you 're going .
moreover , is the <unk> for you very important .
the fact is that , if you just by one , the price down could , to <unk> the more energy in near the most effective .
now , the <unk> is about the time , like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> drive in the industrial revolution in and even in the 20th century . there was a <unk> case in <unk> and why we refrigerators -- that painless , we could dispense with materials on , and so many things .
we are so in a wonderful situation with electricity in the wealthy world .
but , if we the price down -- we have the price to half -- we 're hitting on a new boom and this barrier is closely with carbon .
co2 fed up with the planet and the equation for carbon dioxide 's actually very clear .
they <unk> that <unk> co2 , which to <unk> lead and this <unk> has some pretty negative effects . effects on the weather and maybe even worse , the . this is a consequence that the natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes not able to and so a whole systems , come together .
now , the exact number of connection between a <unk> and the it gains <unk> and where they were more important consequences are , there 's some <unk> , but not a lot .
and there are certainly <unk> of how bad , those consequences will . but they 'll be very unhappy being .
i have the <unk> times , and asked , `` we really need down near zero to come ?
do better than half of or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we 're near zero to come to be the temperature will rise .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a 3.5 feet high office truck , in three feet a bridge from mortality . the then you can actually getting back down .
this must be looking down , at zero .

every american about 20 tons . people of the poor countries , a time .
on average , there are about five million tons for everyone on planet .
and somehow we need to change before , that looked at zero to lower .
it 's been consistently up .
just different economic transformations to have it actually affects and we need of <unk> rise to wealthy country go and to a gas emissions up to zero .
this equation , has four factors . a little multiplication problem . they have this thing left -- and co2 -- that they 're moving towards zero wants them to , and this is of the number of people depend on , of the service of every man on average use , the average of energy for any service and the co2 , this is an energy <unk> .
let 's see so every single factor of them back and i think we , like this to make up to get .
probably have a lot of these numbers very close at zero to come .
now this is the basic algebra , but let 's time through .
first , we the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people ,
and it is progressing towards at 9 billion to . the at 9 billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could that i think about 10 percent or 15 percent mortality down , but now we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second element of these are the services that we use .
that includes all of the food that we eat , clothing , tv , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> mean , those services are almost every working on planet have access to do .
it 's fantastic , that this number drops .
in the wealthy world , in the upper half billion , we could possibly <unk> do and less energy efficient , but on average will this number of every year to grow up and so many more than double , the number of services , the per person to be provided .
we see a very basic services . there 's home , and light , so you the homework can read it ?
and these students have n't it , so they go out and reading your schoolwork whatsoever by the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the power per service , there 's got news .
we have something that 's not going up ,
because of success in <unk> , from other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , their energy , some of those services are now by 90 percent decrease .
in other vital service , the production of <unk> , is 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> , is the window for improvement is very much smaller .
in general , if we which are , we might be a reduction a factor of three or maybe a factor of six .
but at the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion in may <unk> 13 billion tons of the rest . and that does n't come out !
we look so the fourth factor of -- and this is a x-factor in his -- this is the amount of co2 , the per unit of energy <unk> .
it turns out the question , if you that at zero can get .
if you coal , burning , no .
if you gas will burn , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> not prevent co2 , except that renewables , and my rocketry that .
so , what we were on a global level have to do , is , a new system to create .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders , '' i use , i mean not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
and the internet and its little bottle is a miracle .
the people here have to the development of a lot of this miracle that contributed .
normally , there 's not a deadline , that you a miracle to a certain date , it needs .
usually if you 're just wrong and some people come to others not .
in this case , we need , but you floor , and give a miracle in very long time .
now , i wondered , how to do this <unk> ?
there 's a natural numbers , a demonstration of the idea of people here to me ?
i remembered the last year , when i mosquitos to paint and somehow i liked the people that .
the idea was for you actually intangible , you know that there are some of dealing with these life .
for energy , i noticed this .
i decided that <unk> of fireflies make my <unk> contribution to be here would be .
here are so a couple of natural or fireflies .
you 've got me that insured that they do n't bite . actually going to do n't think that time that glass , left .
now , there are all kinds <unk> like this , but they bring all not much .
we need technological solutions , either one or a couple of an incredible this scaling , and most incredible dependability . and although it many ways , there , where people to look for i do see just five of these big market in can afford .
i have the tides , <unk> , the merger and better biofuels out .
these are doing maybe one ; on the contributions and if you better job as i expect to that would be good , but my the core here is that we at all those five to work have , and we ca n't of you give up , because they us to continue mounting block , because all have significant problems .
we look at this burning fossil fuels , burning of either of coal or gas .
what you where do need to seem to be easy , but this is n't . you could have all the co2 , that after the burning of clockwork key ingredient comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then , somewhere between them , and hope that there 's left .
there are some piloted , that looked at a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it on 100 percent to be very difficult to be . and an agreement for the storage of co2 to produce , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who 's going to make sure ?
who can be rewarding , which literally , many billions of times bigger than any kind of waste , the you out of <unk> and other things we can imagine ?
this is a lot of volume .

next was : my rocketry that .
who has three major problems . the cost , particularly in <unk> countries are high . the question for certainty that you really feel that nothing wrong can walk , despite the human participation . that the fuel not a weapon being used .
and what do you go to the garbage patch ?
because although he did n't it 's very large , there 's a lot of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may be solvable are , and in which you why do work should .
the last three of the five , i 've summarized why .
there are those renewables , how they often be called .
and also the have -- although it is great that they do n't make fuel you need -- they have some downsides .
one is the <unk> of these technologies create dramatic lower than the <unk> .
that are <unk> , you talk from many <unk> , times more slippery surface than a normal power .

the sun shines , not the whole day , they seem to do n't every day and it blows with the wind and not only thing .
so you have , if you of these various sources that 's dependent on , a way to have to the energy , in times when you do is available , to get .
there are so large <unk> . there are challenges in the transmission . if example , let 's say that the power of your country is , you do n't just the technology , they also need to the risk around that the energy from where different from .
and there 's the <unk> .
and the level to show , i 've all kinds of life , who are going to view , the cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for anything . and that i 've got the amount of electronic energy , which the world 's using , comparing them . i found that all of life that we 're going to produce , less than 10 minutes of maintains them , you could .
we need so here 's a big medical breakthrough , something that a factor of us will be better than is , as the approaches the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not that .
it 's happening , you 're trying to these <unk> sources about saying we 20 percent -- 30 percent of falls into .
if they began to 100 percent for support that we want to do you need an incredible <unk> .
now , where we going to go , what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project ? how we come out into the goal ?
what we need are many companies , the working on . hundreds .
in each of these four areas we need at least 100 people .
for many of you will say , who are crazy ! it 's good .
i think , here in the ted community learner , there 's a lot of the out there are engaged .
bill by one has multiple different companies , among other one of <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies , the great things do and interesting ways to have and i try this to support .
nathan myhrvold and i pay for a company that , may surprise , the nuclear approach to follow .
there are some innovations in <unk> being modular , agile .
the construction has in this industry while ago years ago , so it 's no big surprise that some good ideas lying .
this <unk> that means you instead of a part of <unk> , the one percent of the <unk> , we decided to the 99 percent of burning , that <unk> .
that 's quite a crazy idea .
but actually did you about some time thinking , but you could never make our capability , whether it would work , but since it in a supercomputer that there , you can do it to simulate and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it look like this is it 's <unk> .
and because you that 99 percent of burning , is that <unk> very much better .
actually burning , you the garbage , and you can even the waste of today reactors operate as <unk> use .
instead , about the head to break , burn it 's easy . a great thing .
the low-enriched uranium dioxide is too used to a little bit like a candle that .
you see that 's kind of a bar is , often than `` a traveling wave of the reactor . ''
that solves another thing that <unk> .
here 's a picture of their place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you have the piece of this is to burn it 's going to <unk> so there 's <unk> uranium .
the reverse the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you <unk> cheap and just <unk> , you get enough of fuel for the rest of lifetime of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's an example of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to come .
think we , how we do our success is that .
how should we have a testament to look ?
now , we go to put her goal , that we might have and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many talk from an 80 percent reduction , until 2050 .
it 's really important that we go along these things .
the rest of 20 percent are in the poorest countries to be produced , and still a little farm . hopefully will <unk> and cement , until then clean .
so , this around 80 percent to get to have the developed world , including the countries like china , their <unk> completely change .
the other note she says , whether we are <unk> technology that advocate , if you in all the developed countries used is , and we the way are , you to the rest to get .
this is really important .
this is a key element that <unk> .
if we from there back , how to this is 2020 as testament to look ?
it should be coming in the two elements in them .
we should the <unk> use to reduce the journey way . get less we <unk> to go down to the <unk> be and so that , the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things that we do that do n't fully to the big , <unk> lead , just a moment , or even a little less important as the other , which the rapidity of innovation for this amazing breakthroughs , it .
this amazing breakthroughs , we need to you floor to track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there are many great books to this subject .
that al gore 's `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> `` <unk> energy <unk> the think about air . ''
they take it really , and create a framework , where this as a major problems can be , because we need for support of all sides .
there 's a few things that comes together .
this is a request .
a very specific than the desire to this technology , innovate .
if you me just a wish for the next 50 years , allow , i could the president to choose to a telephone lasts , and that i love , i could this desire , given the message says , <unk> <unk> without adding co2 being reinvented . this desire to take , i .
this has the biggest impact .
if we have this desire to do n't get , is digging between the long and that business people are terribly disorganized to be between the united states and china , between the poor and the rich countries . and almost all live in these two billion are very much worse .
what we need to do then ?
for which means for <unk> i ?
we need for the context of those .
if countries , in places like <unk> meeting , they should not just about carbon to talk .
they should those <unk> to go and they were shocked by the work with money , the for this using it approaches to spend .
we need <unk> , carbon taxes , <unk> that trade something that a <unk> does .
we need to spread the message .
we have a dialogue <unk> and full of take and also the things that the government to be done .
it is a desire , but i think , we can see him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . just about <unk> something better to understand -- yeah , you get us an idea of the scale that investment be ?
bill gates : the simulation in a supercomputer to do , all the great scientist to get , what we 've done , we need only some 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian nuclear reactor tested have to ensure that there must make it works , is you only in the <unk> million .
the tough to step is this building of the first <unk> , another billion to find the <unk> and the place in fact , the first of them .
once the first time . it is , when he 's how as i promised , then everything is very clearly , because the sense , the <unk> is so different than at my rocketry , how we know it .
about this straight to understand : that means a deep in the ground to build a little bit like a vertical pillar of a nuclear <unk> , that sense deployed <unk> and then starting to the process , up , and working out on after the bottom ?
bg : right . now you have the reactor , a new <unk> , so there are many people and lots of monitoring that go wrong . this thing where you know it opens and things <unk> or are going . this is not good .
but when you very cheap fuel you have , you can tell him for 60 years <unk> -- you think about a column -- that you have been buried , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's sitting there , and takes for 60 years and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , even a solution for the garbage by those .
bg : yeah . so what the garbage is happening , you can see him sitting here -- there are much less junk shot with this method -- then they pick it , and grab him in the next reactor and burn up .
and we start , by we the waste to take the already exists , in that 's <unk> or <unk> at the reactors is . this is our <unk> .
so this is , which for these reactors run a problem was that , what we in your fill and it 's <unk> dramatically reduce that during this process .
but while you with different people , this world about these choices we 've talked ,
where 's the best interest , so what actually implement ?
bg : well we still not on a place as reading and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is . there are passion and people from a company was in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the energy , i met and talked about , like this to <unk> fit .
i 'm optimistic . you know , and the french and the japanese and have something in the direction .
this is a nuance , one thing that was done .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a very quickly this reactor and some countries have this building , why is every one that 's a whirlwind tour of reactor , which has to a <unk> for our first .
in your imagination , <unk> and more likely to that really get involved in to call ?
bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that they 're very affordable , we have 20 years to innovate and then 20 years to use .
this is like the deadline of us the <unk> nobody has that we all need .
and , you know , <unk> , if all walks , and this is a lot of the desire , it could easily give them .
and fortunately , there 's dozens of companies , and we needed hundreds of , as well , if those approaches worked , the funding for your drone pilots to work , for <unk> .
and it 's the best , if it 's what do , because then you could a mixture of using .
definitely going to do we need a solution .
<unk> the great possible breakthroughs , is this the biggest , that you know ?
bg : a <unk> is announcing .
it 's also , without the <unk> been , but that makes it so much more important .
in a nuclear sector , there are some innovative companies .
you know , we 've met whose job is not the best way that , but there are modular method that 's a different approach .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which is something which seems , but you might say that helps us .
and so there are different , but this beautiful thing is that a <unk> a million times as much energy has a , , we 're saying , a <unk> and therefore , if you with the problems can get around and they are mainly in the radiation , the footprint and the cost , it does that capability , so the impact on this country and other things , almost in a kind of the league table .
if that does n't , then what ?
we need <unk> need to try to the <unk> stable enough to hold ?
bg : when you in this situation where it 's as if you ate too much has , and about to heart attack . what do you go ? you must be a <unk> or anything .
there 's a <unk> that they <unk> called the end up with various techniques , trying to the warming continues to delay , so we 20 or 30 years longer had to us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope that we do n't need .
some people say , you should not only on the insurance will work because of this may be lazy , you can continue to eat , because you know that one of the <unk> save .
i do n't know if that 's smart , is , we 're into the importance of this problem , but leads , but there 's a larger discourse in <unk> about , if you this available to have to , if the things rapidly go , or this innovation longer need , when we expect .
change deniers like , you have a or two lines for the to you might have to convince them ?
bg : well , unfortunately , in the skeptics in very different the camp .
the ones , the scientific case and do , are very much .
they say that 's negative effect there , the with the clouds to have to the things here ?
there 's very , many things that they do you can say , of whom it 's a chance in a million there .
this <unk> here 's like with aids .
you do is the mistake now , and you pay for much later .
and why is the idea , now , if you all kinds compiled all have issues , in something to invest in that you do n't until later , which has -- and to get that the investment is not that 's obvious . in fact is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst case scenario , and there are people in the wealthy world of the ipcc are watching and say , okay , this is no big , drama .
the fact is that uncertainty of us out to make a moment .
but my dream is that , it , economic can do , and with the co2 was eliminated , then say , the skeptics , `` okay , it does n't interest me that 's no carbon <unk> , i wish to close to think it did that , but i 'm going to it would accept , because it 's cheaper than the prior technology . ''
and that would your answer to the <unk> scientist argument that , if you look at that time and energy use to the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals to have suffered , the <unk> , the proper of malaria and so on that 's a stupid waste of resources to the money for to invest , while it better stuff is that we can do .
bg : well , the actual expenses for the research -- let 's the u.s. , be 10 billion per year 's going to spend when you do today -- that 's not as dramatically .
and underneath them , the other things do n't hurt .
you come to go to big <unk> , and here we can make reasonable people disagree with , if you something has , that 's not economic growth is , and trying to this to finance . for me that 's happening here the most of waste .
it was because , it 's about to <unk> and financed , but then the curve . i think we should be more things are trying to the potential to have , very much cheaper to be .
if the <unk> , the you get to a very high <unk> is , then you can only the rich to compete .
i mean , each of us here i could take five times as much for our energy to spend , without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even a scientist who thinks about .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research has n't talking about ? ''
he 's still , because of its former stories , with <unk> crying , but he understood that a very rare group is , and therefore does he now that <unk> .
and this is a empathize , the i for the way back .
the research , it 's just nuts , how much in the support .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope that your desire to be true . you very much .
bg : thanks .
few years ago , at ted , so peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is pretty simple . <unk> have the biggest <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about . <unk> tape , about . <unk> thread , and a marshmallow ; building .
the marshmallow got up on it might be .
and , although it really just seems , it 's actually really hard , because it people respond very quickly work together .
and so i thought , that this is an interesting idea is , and i have it in a <unk> landscape .
it was a huge success .
since i spent about 70 workshops and the world run , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there 's something about this task , what as it 's some insights into the nature of cooperation into city and i want some of them to share .
typically takes off the most people to speak about the task to orient .
you talk about , you look at how it will look , they are juvenile way around the power ,
then putting them a little time in planning and organization . you drawing and put <unk> out .
they invest in a lot of their time in the to build the time plummeting and structures
and finally , just before they could n't go to have more , taking somebody decodes the marshmallow and they put him gently in the top , join me step back and `` <unk> ! '' admire their work .
what but then , almost always , what happens is that `` <unk> '' to a `` <unk> '' is , because that weight of the marshmallow , it does that the whole thing to bend , and <unk> .
there 's a series of people , the more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have more than others , and under the worst of fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and there of course , from the more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have and under the best people are the freshness of the alumni of this kindergarten .
and this is quite astounding .
like us -- in a story about how we 're not just the highest towers , but the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask you get there is : how that ? why ? what is with whom ?
and peter 's told , `` none of kids spend time it was the <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they invest , no time in <unk> .
but there 's another reason .
and now , that mba students get trained by , the a real plan to find , ok !
and then to realize .
then what happens , if you the marshmallow for the top of profanity , you have no time and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> do differently -- is , you with the marshmallow is beginning and prototypes to successfully prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they repeatedly the ability to have <unk> prototypes to fix .
constructionists recognize this kind of collaboration as a core of a <unk> are about .
and with every attempt to get the children , sort of feedback , what works and what do n't .
so is the performance , to prototypes to work , far -- but we look at once , how different teams to operate .
the average for the most 's around about . <unk> of mba students make half of the lawyers are more mundane , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , the process .
<unk> is the ultimate , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles , understanding and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to build systems to build .
the ceos are about average . but here it gets interesting .
i 'll show you a will administrator at the team , you going to dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you see and began to see , `` this team who will win . ''
you can the predictions . why it work ?
because they 're special faculties to the <unk> have .
they pour the process , you understand him .
and that team , that regulates body and the work to pay attention to the performance of teams and dramatically improve .
propagated skills and <unk> and that combination of lead to succeed .
if you 10 teams have to the unique to do to get you ca . 6,000 people to build systems have .
i tried to a little electrons .
i thought , we bring the <unk> same .
so she offered me a $ 10,000 dollars a price of software for the winner .
what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had to build a structure .
if someone 's a <unk> high , which we have , he could have the price back for carried out .
so is not interesting is that high <unk> a profound effect ?
we reenacted this exercise with our students .
what they think it was happening now ?
well understood you the advantage of `` <unk> . ''
so i saw the same , bad at one among the best .
they were producing the highest construction in the least of time .
there are so <unk> lessons for us , over the nature of propulsion , and success .
you might ask : why would somebody actually go into a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and they come to multidisciplinary teams to help , cars , video games , `` <unk> <unk> '' to make it .
and what the <unk> do is , they 're helping them makes one got to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge and offers a shared experience , a common language , or obstruction . ethos , the right prototype to build .
and this is one and this experience , this is how to an exercise .
and those of you that 's interested , can <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see , how to the marshmallow is building .
there 's a <unk> there .
you find any examples of the world , how people that system to optimize and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is , this structure actually a <unk> sports .
it requires that we all our senses at the exercise your eyes and that our thinking , optimal use , how our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the front of us is .
and sometimes it 's a small prototype this experience anything , what it needs to us from `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' moment to bring .
and this is a big difference do .
thank you .
we do such as we have this one machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and this is a machine .
and everyone in this room must go inside .
and you can in the past , you can in the future to go ; they can not in here and now to
and i wonder , what you would , because i my friends in the last time , often asked this question i have , and they wanted everybody in the past and go .
i do n't know . they were interested in the time ago , before it 's car , there or twitter or `` america 's looking at the american idol '' .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you some way to nostalgia , and wishful thinking , with is .
and that i do know .
i 'm not a bunch of the group , i must say .
i 'm not in the past , and that 's not , because i 'm a <unk> 'm --
it 's because that are on planet does n't go back , you go ahead .
so i want in this machine , and i want to the future to go .
this is the greatest time that it , depending on planet , there , however , which the scale , they make : health , wealth , and mobility , the opportunities , at declining <unk> .
there was never quite a time , like this .
my <unk> died of all when she turned 60 years .
my grandparents had urged her this number of 70 .
my parents are the 80/20 on the <unk> .
there should so eloquently than a nine the beginning of my <unk> stand .
but it 's not just about people like us , because this is a major thing as this .
a kid , that today in delhi 's born can expect , so long to live as the richest man on the 100 years ago .
you think about it . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . of smallpox would have a billion people on planet killed .
they have the demographics of earth a way that 's new form , how it 's no war , depending who did .
they are out . they have vanished .
we have you <unk> . ' .
in the wealthy world are diseases , the millions of us , just one generation , they have to do n't yet .
<unk> , <unk> , polio --
you know that does anybody else , which is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to billion people to feed that are some successes the scientific method .
and from my perspective is the scientific method that stuff in trying to look , if it works , it will change , if it 's not doing , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , that 's been around the good news , because there is a few other problems , and they were frequently said ,
and one of this is that despite all of our greatest achievements , a billion people the world at every day all , to go down .
this number drops , and they are rising very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and not just that , we have our imagination used to , this world that we had to it okay .
drinking water , <unk> country , the rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , and that as soon , and if we 're not from this chaos <unk> go so we also .
the question is so , we can do that ? i think it .
i think it 's clear that we food can produce , the billion people eat it will , without the country , on your life , to rape her .
i think , we can this world with power that they 're not both being destroyed .
i think that really , and no , this is not thinking .
but this keeps me at night when i -- one of the things that makes me at night when i think . we have scientific advance , had n't like wen needs it was like now , never ,
and we were also never the capacity , it properly <unk> , like us , it today .
we 're on the cusp of amazing , astonishing design events in many places . and yet , i really , that we are hundreds of 300 years ago , the enlightenment . go back to have to a time to find , we have fought have , we about these things <unk> <unk> have , at the lines , now .
people copying putting yourself in their faith , which is so intimately that you do n't release it .
ca n't even the truth will you free .
and they stop , everybody has a fairly prosaic in their opinion ; even a fairly prosaic in their opinion , for progress ,
but you know , what they 're not right ?
they have no right on their own facts . <unk> , you have n't .
and i have a while i needed to that out .
before about a decade , i have an article about the shots for `` the new yorker , '' written , a small paper .
and i was amazed at the resistance to bump , on the resistance towards at what 's over the most effective activity in health in the history of humanity .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did n't know what i always do , i wrote an article and on .
and soon after that i wrote an article about <unk> changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
people were getting crazy .
so i think about an article written , and i could n't understand , why people thought , it , `` <unk> '' , why they believed that molecules on a certain types taking a random jumble of move a <unk> on this area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the articles , i kept going .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we tap , we do a , we go food , that 's okay .
but these papers -- made me worried , and i could n't figure out , why , and finally , i found it out .
and that 's because that these <unk> , the me nuts were all ? no <unk> were .
that were <unk> people , educated people , a decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and this led me so persistent confusion --
but then i thought , you know what , let 's be honest .
we 're on a point where there , on that we 're not just the same relationship to advance of as before .
we 're talking <unk> them .
we talk to be ironic them , with a quote about , `` the progress . ''
okay , that there 's reasons , and i think we know , which causes that are .
we have this faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science , lost , and there is no reason why is not that should be .
you can just a few do n't and people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the pieces , <unk> , of mass , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can your list of the vote .
there are questions and problems to the people , of which we believed that they always right now . be so they are skeptical .
suppose you ask , as they 're able to urge you some evidence .
you take nothing as being handed down .
but now it 's the thing : if you 're able to get you have this evidence to adopt , and it , we 're not good .
and i can that 's from the reason to say , we now in an epidemic of fear for life , how do i never saw and hopefully i 'll never see it 's going .
before about 12 years was a story posted , a terrible story that the <unk> with <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> lasts and in the connection made .
very scary .
tons of studies have been done to see if that 's true .
tons of studies we should be conducted at this is a serious business .
the data coming in .
the data coming in the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all right , no significant correlation , no link , no .
it does n't matter . it does n't matter , because we of anecdotes -- believe , we think , what we see , what we to see to believe what does that we really feel .
we believe that 's not at a bunch of documents from a <unk> , of us data , there , and i understand that , i think that do we all .
but you know what ?
the result of it was a catastrophic ,
and surreal , because of this fact , the u.s. is one single countries in the world , where the immunization for <unk> down .
this is absolutely scandalous outrage , and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
what happened is that we do that could .
now , i understand that . that i 'm doing .
because he 's someone <unk> ?
has one in the audience ever hear somebody on <unk> die see ?
it 's not many times .
what happens in this country , no , but the 160,000 time in the world in the last year .
that are many deaths from <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not happening here is , we can it into denial , and people like jenny mccarthy , can walk around and sending messages of fear and illiteracy around the platforms like watching oprah and larry king live to preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation was not connecting .
they do n't understand that these things that does seem to be , but almost never the same thing .
and this is something that we need to learn , which is very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk institute .
it liberated us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
not afraid , no matter-of-factly , polio , they shut , gone .
the guy in the middle , not so much .
he called `` paul <unk> .
he just with a few other people a <unk> developed .
he can the life of <unk> , a million children per year in the developing to save .
well , not ?
now , which is good , except for that paul around and through vaccines , speak , and says , how valuable they are , and that just people stop them to complain .
and that says he actually so .
paul 's a terrorist .
if paul in a public <unk> talks , he ca n't being armed foot for example of statements .
he 's getting calls home , because people would like to tell you know where his kids going to school .
and why ? paul a vaccine did .
i do n't need this say , but the vaccines are essential .
so you put them to continue to go out of these maladies come back , terrible disease , and this is happening now .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and that gets worse , and pretty soon be kids back about dying , because it 's just an issue of numbers .
and they 're not just about <unk> die .
what is the polio this ? we take this . why not ?
a <unk> of me that 's got me on a few weeks , writing and told you think i 'm a little to <unk> .
nobody has that ever said earlier .
they would their children did not against polio immunized . no way .
subtle .
why ? because we do n't see polio , and you know what ?
we had in this country , yesterday , none of polio virus .
now , i do n't know , maybe i went from now this morning guy in lagos , a plane and fly right after the los angeles , right now , he 's about ohio .
and in a few hours , goes up and <unk> a car , and he comes after a long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight it has gone .
and he does n't know that it with a stock disease is living is , and we know that 's not , because it 's how the world 's .
this is the planet , and we live . they do n't like , as though he does this is .
we love it to us in the lie to pile . we love this .
you have today , the morning everybody their supply vitamins to see what ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you of the can help .
i know , that you 've done , because half the americans , that every day , power .
you take this stuff , and you take this alternative to cure , and it does n't matter , how often we find out that she 's futile .
the data really made the time .
you , dimming to their urine . do more you almost never .
that 's okay , they want to 28 billion dollars for the dark , urine of numbers .
i agree with you 're too .
it took their urine . dark .
why we doing this ? why we doing this ?
now , i think , i understand -- we hate the pharma industry .
we hate each one too strong government . we have n't trust the solar system .
and that we should n't either . our healthcare system is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> to us that it be able to do .
we go so before that way , and where we go to do ?
we walk in the poor of the <unk> .
that 's great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , it 's a serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we billion dollars for .
and i 've all kinds of little tour through here .
none of them -- <unk> , cheating , <unk> , cheating , <unk> , because i do n't even what this is , but we put a billion dollars for it out , it 's very serious .
and you know what ? when i 'm saying that , shouting at me , people in and say , `` what does it you ? let the people , but do , what you want .
so they feel good . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
it because i donâ€™t care is , whether it 's the minister is , says , `` hmm , i 'm going to the evidence of my research and a digital mammography does n't suppose '' or any <unk> , their patient with <unk> treat us wants .
if you look at the road entering , where i think , and magic of members and you do n't tell us to get them on a place , on that we do n't want to be .
they get to , thabo mbeki 's in south africa .
he taught by its people around , because he 's what was that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more than any antiretroviral drugs are , of which we know that you the course of aids , braking system .
hundreds undue deaths in a country , the worse than any other of this disease <unk> .
they tell me not that these things are no grave implications of .
who have you . that you have always .
now , the <unk> epidemic , we face now , is this ridiculous , struggle between the <unk> <unk> <unk> food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about the words , about metaphors .
this ideology , not science .
everything , what we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , every <unk> , by the people changed .
you know , there was no <unk> in the garden .
there was no <unk> .
there was no christmas trees . we have this all done .
we have it in the last thousand years .
and some has worked and some of it 's not .
we 're getting rid of what did n't work .
now we can be more to do . and of course there risks . but we can also , the vitamin a in rice , do , and this stuff can million people who , million people , their lives to extend .
this is n't you want to do ?
i must say , understand that i do n't .
we refuse <unk> changed the food .
why we do that ?
so what i 'm listening is : too many of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we want to do n't tolerate vast areas with one thing , it 's wrong .
we do n't want to be companies alive and patent .
we do n't want to be companies seeds have .
and you know , what my answer on all this is ?
yes , they 're right . fix this to make .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but this is not science .
this has to do nothing to do .
it 's right , right now , <unk> .
you know that the science , not a company is .
she 's no country .
she 's not just an idea ; she 's a process .
she 's a process , and sometimes it works , he and sometimes not , but the idea that we the science is not allow them , their work to do , because we 're afraid of is really a dead , and they keep millions of people from the human flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years we will cover 70 percent more food have to grow as the moment . 70 percent .
that investment in africa in the last 30 years .
shame . shame .
they need that , and we give it did n't want .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we want people not just encourage , this <unk> stuff to eat , like for example <unk> .
<unk> is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's something like a potato .
it 's just a bunch calories . it 's miserable .
it does n't require nutrients , it does n't have protein , and scientists building that all right at a .
and then they could people that food and would n't be blind be .
they would n't starving , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything , what i 'll say that is : why are we have that ?
i mean , we ask : why are we have that ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about , genetics move . it 's not about the chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for our hormones , our persist in your food , better food , act of food .
it 's not exactly a rice <unk> , it 's about , people are alive to get , and it 's not our first time , to understand what this .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do , if we so on making such as far i do we 're looking at a little bit guilty , in which we , i think , not guilty to be , high-tech colonialism .
it there is no description for this , what this .
it 's become selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our not worthy , and we have this really stop .
after this amazing kind of entertainment , they want so we might say , you will you still in this ridiculous machine , and in the future to go ? ''
in any case . that i want to any rate .
the moment , put them in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can see this machine , at all ask , what we want .
we can you 're moving , where we 're moving to , and we 're going forward to move , where we want .
we have these conversations that lead , and we need to think , but if we in the machine , here , and in the future of going to be happy to be done this have them .
i know that we do it can , and here 's far as i can is something , what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
've been i 'm interested in the <unk> . it might seem curious , that at a magician interested in that it was because , you look at it as i believe , as `` a deception , the to something real space is , when someone just hard enough , i believe . ''
with other words , <unk> have in some studies of measurable effect , i showed the <unk> , which is just so , because the person thinks , what to her going to be a pharmaceutical companies , or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there , if the patient 's hard enough , i believe , a measurable effect of the body that you the <unk> calls .
a delusion is going to something real , because somebody 's how it sees .
so that we 're also understanding , i want you now a fundamental , very trick to show .
and i 'm going to show you saw it works . this is a trick , the least for the 1950s , in any <unk> for children .
i have him from <unk> <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s , learned .
i 'm going to him for you do to and then you explain .
and then i 'm going to explain why i would explain .
so , you see , what happens .
that knife , that they 're able to all my hand , the you look across .
i 'm going to the knife , so in my off to keep them .
i 'm not pleading my sleeve , back .
and to ensure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , or from him out , i 'll just my wrist , right here <unk> .
this way you can see that self-folds into any time something kept moving . as i 'm here <unk> , i ca n't in my sleeve , as it or out .
and the goal of it 's very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is that knife by my bare physical , magnetics ago .
it 's sitting in fact that stuck in its place that i do it shake it , without that knife falls off .
nothing goes into my sleeve , or it comes out , no <unk> . and they can study .
<unk> !
well , this is a trick , the i think our little kids affect the , for magic , study , because you can do with very much about deception to learn , if you look closely , although it 's a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of you in this room that trick .
he works is the way .
i think that knife in my hand .
i say that i became my wrist <unk> , to ensure that nothing in my sleeve disappears , or out , and this is a lie .
the reason that i my wrist <unk> , is that at the real secret of the illusion is .

wonderful trick ?
and go back there is someone , not a childhood had .
so , he sits around here . right .
and when i <unk> , changing the finger at .
and now you could talk about why this point of is , why do n't seeing that down here 's just three fingers to see are , because the mind and the way that he information processing , they 're not one that counts , one , two , three , but you as a group can see .
but it 's about now here 's not actually , and then i open my hand .

and when i mean , i 'll have to happen the same thing , by i <unk> , going through this movement overhead , that the hands up <unk> .
i 'll use these hand away . and there is the knife .
this usb key that you can be your friends and the neighbors just run . thanks .
now , which has the <unk> to do ?
a year ago , or so , i read a study that i 'm really right away .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so i was that for me an amazing thing .

but if you the shape , you that <unk> give , for example , in a smaller pill to change , and these blue color and a letter that <unk> , is they actually is measurably so much .
and that , although almost none of any of pharmaceutical industry ... there are just <unk> .
but a white ball is not as well , a blue pill .
what ? that made me really crazy .
it turned out , but out that is n't stop there is .
if you capsules are coming out , are more effective than pills and every form .
a colored the capsule , the one of the yellow and the red is that 's better than a white capsule .
well , the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day 's not as well as three pills -- i can i 'm not at the exact does n't remember . i 'm sorry .
this critical , but is , ...
... that 's also the <unk> a play .
and the shape plays a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to , you have to the needle that makes them .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance that you a patient , attached .
that creates a very powerful image in mind . this is very much worse than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to do you one another time to show , if we have a <unk> have .
the fact , so this is that the white ball and not so it looks like the blue pill , are not so it looks like a cramped capsule , are not so it looks like the needle .
and none of it has some really have pharmaceutical property . it 's only way we think about , in us a greater impact by .
i wanted to know if i did this idea for a magic trick to take action .
i 'll do something that obviously a delusion is , and let 's really look .
we know from the study that you to the needle that makes them have , if it to it supposed to go .
a this is an inch long <unk> . she 's very , <unk> . and i 'm going to you start with a little bit to render time .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . that is no special from hollywood .
i 'll discuss this needle in my skin and bite through them up , until you on the other hand , again , rises up .
if you not by -- if you can easily in famished and fall -- i have this is a few friends , the last night in the hotel room , demonstrated , and some people that i do n't know , and it 's a woman : he 'd .
and i 'm so , if you 're not going , then you looking for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm going to the first <unk> piece here back to do .
you can it 'll see , you can but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it goes like , right here , where my ham starts , on the bottom of my <unk> i 'll just a small one puncture , do .
i 'm really sorry . they make this crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and the other way back out .
now we 're actually in the same kind of us , <unk> had .
about .
but now you can be my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , i 'm going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know , what people imagine , if you see that .
they say , `` okay , the 's certainly not so stupid and <unk> itself in the skin , just for us a few minutes long to talk . ''
now , then i 'm going to show you .
look like this from ? well .
yes , i know .
and people came back to say , `` okay . i do n't seen . ''
people in the <unk> come here in .
they let 's me give you from near the show .
it 's my skin . that is no special from hollywood .
this is my ham , and i can that 's swivel around .
i 'm sorry . if you not going to you take away , you looking not going .
and get back or the , the that later , some time on video that will say , `` well , that looks very well , fairly impressive out , but if it 's really would , he would -- you see , here 's a hole and there , if it now it would , it would we bleed . ''
okay , they let me a little blood for you <unk> .
yes , it there .
usually i would go through the needle take anything .
i would my arm would take and to show that 's not our wounds .
but i think , in this picture here and the intention , from a delusion is something we had to do , i 'm going to the needle . just sitting there , me , and so the stage and go .
we are the next few days a couple more time to face .
i hope you look forward has been on . thank you .
everybody talks about today about that happiness .
i have some people the number of books , as well let of dealing with `` <unk> '' in the title , in the last five years or published by and they gave after about 40 up , and there was a lot more .
there 's a massive wave of interest of happiness in the explorers .
there 's very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people happy to do .
but despite all of tide of work , there is -- cognitive biases can think that 's sort of almost impossible to make sure about happiness -- thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive map of those action .
this is for significant , the about your own happiness might think , and it 's for scientists , the about happiness might think , because it turns out that we so just mess that are like everybody else .
the first of traps is a <unk> , which are actually acknowledge .
it turns out that the word `` happiness is simply not a useful in the word carrying is , because we do it up to many different things work .
i think , there 's a particular meaning , on the let 's just could , but in a big and all this is something that we are also need to be , and we 're going to the complicated over , would have to let 's the well-being is .
the second case is a people confuse of experience and memory , basically consists of them between be happy in his life and be happy about his life or happy with his life .
and these are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the idea from happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the <unk> fact that we 're not about a situation that think we can , the well-being is affected , without its significance to warp .
i mean , this is a real cognitive and trap .
there 's simply no way , it right down to get .
now i 'd like with an example start by someone , that one <unk> was after one of my lectures , a story told . [ unclear ... '' ] , he said , he had a symphony heard , and it was perfectly , gloriously in music , and at the shot , there was a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then on it on top , really quite emotionally , that has the whole experience of ruins .
but that i did n't .
what it ruined had been the memories of the experience .
he had the experience i had .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
you care , not because it with a memory <unk> was at the memory that was ruined , and the memory that was the end , what he to keep getting had .
what we really saying is that we about ourselves and about other people think we could in terms of two types of self .
there 's a <unk> itself , the observations of the lives and the present and if you know , is able to the past , back to see , but basically just the present .
it 's the <unk> itself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor , asks : `` do now it hurts , when i do here <unk> ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> itself , and that <unk> itself is that <unk> and the story of our lives up , and it 's gamble , that the doctor 's been using it 's the question is asking , `` how they were in the last time that feel ? ''
or `` how was their journey in albania ? '' or a similar .
these are two very different entities , that <unk> themselves and that <unk> itself , and the two to confuse this is part of <unk> of exploring the lucky .
well , this <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that starts really with a basic reaction to our memories of -- it starts in cell .
we tell you 're not just a story , if we can do , stories to tell .
our memory , tells us stories , that is , what we of our experiences and watch over it 's a story .
and they let <unk> with an example start .
there 's an old one study .
that are real patients , projecting yourself a painful procedure participate .
i 'm not far into go . you now is n't hurt anymore , but she was painful , as this study the 1990s done before .
they were asked , everybody loses 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and there are two patients . that are your records .
and they 're wondering , who by both have more suffered ? ''
and this is a very simple question .
patient to b does it definitely more suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient 's `` i 'd had a patient to b , and more .
but now there 's another question : `` how much i thought that these patients that you suffered ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is , the patient 's a lot <unk> <unk> at the <unk> had a patient to b .
the stories <unk> were different , and because a very big part of the story is , how she turned out --
and none of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is substantially worse than the other .
and the , the worse is it , where the pain at on its act . it 's a bad history .
where we know that ?
because we all these people after their <unk> asked them , and too much later , `` how bad was the whole thing in general ? `` well ,
and she was much worse for a , as a b in the <unk> .
well , this is a direct fight between the <unk> themselves and the <unk> itself .
of view of <unk> even had imagine clearly a <unk> time .
so what you with anybody had a , you could do , and we 've actually now done experiments , and it 's been made , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient is a to increase by you just the tube , inside wo n't depend too much about him to up .
this is going to say that the patient who suffers from , but only a little and much less than before .
and if you that a few minutes long makes you have consequences is that <unk> themselves from the patient 's worse off is and you have consequences is that <unk> themselves from the patient is the a lot better off is , because now you have a patient 's a better story about his experience has been .
by being , a story from ?
and this is for the stories of the memory of we found in and it is the same for the stories that we invent .
that makes me , a story i think they benefit to create dramatic moments , and ends .

well , this <unk> own lives in his life and ill-defined .
it has moments of <unk> , one after another .
and you ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're all this is lost forever .
i mean , the most of moments of our lives -- and i have that does -- you know , the psychological presence as being around three seconds long , which means , you know that it 's in a life about 600 million of there . in a month there 's about 600,000 , the most of you do they have no .
the most of you 're completely ignores the <unk> itself .
and yet they get kind of the sense that they count things that 's during these moments of <unk> going on our lives .
it 's the finite resource that we use as we 're on this world .
and how we they consume it would seem important to be , but this is not the story that this <unk> even for us engaged .
so we have the <unk> themselves and that <unk> itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the people interact with time .
of view of <unk> itself , if you a vacation and the second one week , just as well , is how the first , then is the <unk> vacation 's twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
that 's actually not liking that the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation 's better than the <unk> holiday , because there was no new memories , added to be .
they have the story does n't changed .
and the way it 's time actually the edge variable that a <unk> themselves from a <unk> itself . time has very much impact on this story .
well , this <unk> itself is more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's a to gamble , that choice is true , because when you a patient who have to the , we say , two <unk> at two different kinds of surgeons had and they decide , which he would choose to , then this is this , the votes of the brain region has to the less bad thing , and this is the surgeon , the people will .
this <unk> himself has no voice in this choice .
actually we choose not between the experiences . we choose between the memories of experiences .
and even if we at the future thinking , we think about our future is n't usually when experiences .
we think about our future for a <unk> memories .
and basically we can do you look , you know , as a tyranny of <unk> itself , and they do that <unk> even think more than one , this kind of the <unk> even <unk> through experience of the <unk> even do n't need .
i have the sense that if we have an do that a lot of the case is , that means we make a vacation largely a little bottle of <unk> itself .
and this is a little bit hard to justify so , i think .
i mean , how much <unk> we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations that the dominance of <unk> even gave it .
and when i think about , i think about a holiday , the we imagine a few years in antarctica . did , clearly the best vacation trip was , the i ever had , and i think quite often about in proportion to how often i think about the other <unk> think .
and i 've probably of my memory of these <unk> journey , i think about 25 minutes long in the last four years <unk> .
now , when i 've seen the folder has been used to the that you see images of course , i would have another one hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are its peak half hours .
because it seems to get to be .
now , i like a little extremely be , you know , at how little appetite for me on the <unk> of memories i have , but even if you pay more of doing there 's a real question . why we spend their memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we experiences be ?
so i want them to be about an experiment to think .
suppose your next on holidays , you know that the end of <unk> all their pictures of shred , and they get a <unk> drug , so that you to do n't remember being .
now , you were the same vacation and vote ?
and if you a different vacation and vote would , there 's a conflict between your two types of self , and they need to think about how do this conflict to decide , and it 's not obvious , because when you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memories , think you could have another answer to get .
why we are <unk> choose that we choose which is a problem , that , we put them with a choice between the two types of self .
now , the two types of self , throw it was in terms of happiness .
there 's actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one by itself .
so they can ask : how happy that 's <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how happy that , these moments in life of <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- fortunately for those moments , is a fairly complicated process .
which are particularly emotions , the measured it can be ?
and , incidentally , we 're now capable of a pretty good idea to get from fortune of <unk> himself over the time .
if you after the process of <unk> yourself questions , it 's a whole other thing .
this is not them , as happy one person who lives .
it is about how to get happy or by the person is , if this person over their lives think .
very different theory term .
each of these are not from the study of happiness up , and i belong to a lot of scientists about well-being of the study of happiness long as i screwed that have on exactly this way .
the distinction between the process of <unk> themselves and the average happiness of <unk> is yourself in the last decade , actually been , and now , which you out of both individual , to measure .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , at the more than half a million people getting questions was are about that you about your life thinking and about their experiences . and there was another group effort in the direction .
in the last years , we so i started , about this process of those two types of self to learn .
and the main thing that we , i think , we 've learned is that they actually vary .
and do you know , how to please anybody with his life is , and that teaches you really not a lot of how i 'm happy , he compartmentalizes his life living and vice versa .
just about you an idea of the correlation to convey , the correlation 's about <unk> .
what this is that if you who would meet and you would tell you , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about his greatness all know ?
well , they would do something about his greatness all know , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have much uncertainty .
if i tell them that somebody would be life than eight at a scale of 10 <unk> did you have much uncertainty of how i 'm happy , he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about that the average happiness of <unk> off .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is basically means , very pleased to be with people that we like , time to spend with people that we 'd like .
there are other occupational pleasure , but this is a dominant .
so when you that process of those two types of self to maximize that we want you will end very different things .
the implication of the , what i 'm here we 've said this is that we 're lucky to do n't imagine that as a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely another term .
now , very quickly , another one reason , from that we do n't know about happiness might think we can this is that we 're not on the same things look if we think that life thinking and if we actually life .
so when you the simple question , as happy people in california are you will not the correct answer to get .
if you that question to you think that people in california to be happier need if you , we 're saying , in ohio gave life .
and what happens is that if you about that live in california to think , you think about the difference in california , and other places , and that difference is , we 're saying , in climate .
now , it turns out that climate is not very important for the <unk> is yourself , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful about ourselves , this is deciding , as happy people are .
but now , because the thoughtful itself is responsible , you can you end -- some people might end up in california are retracting .
and it 's sort of interesting to track , what happens to anybody who are in california , pull in hopes , especially happy to be .
now , you <unk> themselves will not happy to be .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think that you happier lives are , because if you think about them to be what reminded us to be , how awful the weather in ohio . and they 're going to feel that she 's the right decision was with them .
it 's hard , clear about well-being of thinking , and i hope , i have you an idea of basically , how difficult it 's .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question of them .
thank you .
now , when we imagine a few weeks of his phone 've mentioned before them towards me that 's a pretty interesting happened was that comes from this <unk> survey ever come .
this is something that they us to anticipate they can , because they now a few minutes left ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think the most impressive outcomes , that we 're in the <unk> survey found out of this is a number that we absolutely not to find we did .
we found that produced in this process of <unk> itself .
if we were watching , like emotion , with your income <unk> .
and it turns out that in an income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's been a representative sample , under an income of 600,000 dollars in
60,000 years .
dk : on .
60,000 dollars in the year , people are n't happy , and they 're increasingly less happy , depending on the poorer . they 're going .
what we get a completely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat lines .
and what happens is obvious that the money and do n't <unk> charged , but that lack of money to be , and misery ? you , and we can do is facing very , ok to measure .
in terms of the other self , of <unk> itself , they get another story .
more money you made the increasing levels is you .
this is true no emotions .
but danny , in the entire american now it 's about life , freedom , this quest for happiness .
when people that finding take seriously , would , i mean , it turns out on its head to ask , everything , what we think , for example , in terms of policy and so forth .
there 's a chance that politicians that the country , generally a complementary finding the take seriously , like , and based on politics is going to make ?
dk : you know , i think it 's acknowledged that there for the role <unk> in politics .
the recognition is starting to be in the united states , no question , but in the united kingdom is happening , you just and in other countries that happens when you just .
people are now , recognizing that you about happiness might think should , if you about politics , thinking .
it will be a while , and people will discuss them , if you <unk> seems to , or whether you <unk> to seek out , so we have this discussion is pretty soon .
how to be able to it 's very differently depending on , as you think and if you know about this <unk> even think , or if you know about this <unk> even imagine .
that will require policy changes , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you , that <unk> the population of measuring .
this is , i think , in the next one or two decades of the national statistics .
now , it strikes me , this is subject , or should at least the most important political debate to track to be about the next few years .
thank you the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane mcgonigal , i design games .
i think now been 10 years that online . and my goal for the next decade is , it was as easy to do , the world in reality to rescue , as you in <unk> to rescue .
i have a design for . i want more people believe , including you all , more time with the play the greater and <unk> games to spend .
now we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a whole time for games . ''
maybe a little too much time , when you think about how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve them .
but in fact , my research at the center for the future , according to is the exact opposite is an accurate .

in fact , i 'm convinced that , if we have the next century on planet will survive want to do this time to dramatically increase .
i 've calculated that required at age 21 billion hours <unk> per week is .
this seems to get started doing some <unk> , so again , i do it , so it takes you ca : if we problems like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i think , we need to try to play online for at least , 21 billion hours per week from the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture is pretty precise , why i believe that play , so critical for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .

he wanted to the feelings to play catch . so he was the players have a camera around .
this is one of the classical music when they play .
if you do n't are , we think , you may be some of nuances . in this picture .
you 'll probably this sense of the urgency , a little freaked , but also the antithesis of concentration , it would one in this sort of a really tough problem .
if you also play , you see certain nuances . here , the up <unk> eyes and the mouth , are a sign of teenage optimism . the eyebrows down to show us .
this is a player , the building on a call the epic victory .
oh , you know that . ok , neat . so we have some outstanding players , here .
a <unk> the force is a result , like this very good news is that they were n't know that it possible .
it was almost smoke , beyond the imagination .
and if you do it , they 're shocked , that they actually to do something that can do . this is a <unk> victory .
this bridge player 's about to that epic victory .
and this is it , what we 're going on millions of their faces of <unk> around the world is that we need , if we the paradigm of the next century in attacking . the face of which , the taking all odds on one that epic victory of .
well , unfortunately , we see more like this face in real life , if we difficult problems facing .
i call it as the `` in life , i 'm sick '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes , ok .
this is me , like me that `` in life , i 'm sick '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti and in my kids come home in berkeley , california where i in my ph.d. studying why we in games are better than in real life .
this is a problem , that many football players have .
we think that we in reality not so are like in games .
and i 'm not only eat fewer truck successfully , though that 's ours .
we reach in <unk> more . i mean , in the context of the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to work together .
if we 're in a <unk> are , i believe that many of us into the best we release into , anytime and immediately helpful to are , been the problem to solve are trying to as long necessary , it after the failure , again and try .
and in reality , if we fail , if we have to be insurmountable obstacles are colliding , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel well . we feel threatened to be depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in games , there are you ca n't .
and this is it , what i was a phd student want to look .
why is it into play an impossible to think , you could n't reach it all ?
how do these feelings of the play in the reality in getting ?
so i started looking at play the world of warcraft , that the ideal place for , made a problem solving it .
and i have some things i realized , the epic party in <unk> so we can do .
so , first , if you in one of these online game going , particularly in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters , are willing to you a <unk> mission <unk> , and now .
but not just some justice mission , but a mission , the perfect , to its current level of the game that well , right ?
so they make this .
you 'll never one task that you ca n't solve .
but always on your capability , so they need work . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you 're not around and turning <unk> . it 's always very specific and some important to do .
and there are tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people , who engage with you to their epic mission have forged .
that we have in real life , not as , that feeling that at a <unk> tons of people willing to stand .
moreover , there 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we to have .
then do you get this whole positive feedback .
they 're shaped by `` level up '' and `` plus-one strength , '' or heard `` plus-one emotional intelligence . ''
this constant , feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i this stage , leaving , i did not , is plus-one talk , worth plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life that feedback .
so , the problem <unk> the world of warcraft , is that 's such great satisfaction is , any building on one that epic victory to stand , that we prefer our whole time in that 's <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
this day , have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years , so i spent the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
this is not necessarily bad thing .
it might sound bad .
but about it out in context to see , before <unk> million years , began our first <unk> up to go .
the first upright primate .
ok , so if we talk about , how much time we 're now with them spend , it does that sense , when you , the time in terms of scale of human development in front of your records , what 's extremely stupid .
but also be appropriate . because it turns out that we , by we spend all the way to use , actually changing this , what we as humans , the capacity .
we get us to hear each other business , much beings .
this is the truth . what i believe .
look at once they are interesting statistics , the recent graduating from a researcher at carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man of today , in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours , is a very interesting number of two reasons .
first time , for children in the united states are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> of them in school to spend , the fifth . grade to finish the high school -- if you never been missing .
so we see a complete <unk> , on the young people just learning , what it , a good thing to being , like everything else , what you in school to learn .
and may have some of the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you know about his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
she founded on the great for the <unk> that , if we are 10,000 hours with <unk> out of any subject matter to the 21st century . age of , we 're going to solving it .
we 're so good at whatever to do what the most people the world .
so , what we have here , is a whole generation of young people , the <unk> .
the big question is so , `` what exactly are the players are really good ? ''
because if we do it out how could , we have sort of before there <unk> human potential for .
so many people we currently in the world , the least an hour a day with <unk> spend .
these are our <unk> . 500 million people , are extraordinarily well , `` something . ''
and the next decade we have another billion players , the exceptionally good in whatever .
if you it was n't have heard ,
the games industry develops <unk> , the energy savings and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online games .
you 're expecting an extra one billion of the player in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so what i began to look at what it 's what we these games to solving do .
here are the four things that i found . first thing : <unk> .
ok , put them out that the extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is that urge to go to do something , a challenge to solving , together with the believe that we have a <unk> hope to succeed you have .
players to think always remember that a <unk> the force is possible , and that 's always be worth , it to try , which is the same .
players are not sit around .
are experts in spiders poet of social nets .
there 's a lot more interesting studies , the show that we people more like , after we with you 've been playing , even if you us , `` well have .
the reason for this is that 's a lot of trusting it requires , with somebody a game to play .
we rely on that someone can go to us to spend that the rules <unk> going to the same purpose of , and to stats and by .
so it possible that we see the size of ties to trust and each other .
a number of that we build greater understanding social relations .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason that the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week he plays , like , as <unk> .
the reason is that , if we play , we 're in fact , luckily now , hard to work , as if we relax , or do nothing .
we know that we as human beings , optimal work , if we get very , do .
and are always ready , hard to work , if you the real challenge to get .
and ultimately , epic meaning .
players love it , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> size of being .
here 's a <unk> to that the right-hand turn them back . you know all been wikipedia , the biggest <unk> the world .
the largest <unk> the world , with over 80,000 entries that is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft on the native americans than about some other issue in each other <unk> the world .
they 're creating a very epic story .
they 're creating a very epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , that are so four superpowers , the to a single result . are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
there are of people think of them as a single change the world .
and the only problem is that they believe , you can the virtual worlds to change , but not the real .
this is the problem , that i 'm going to solve four attempts .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is genius . he looked at this , why people much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to witness of not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that by an economist . so he 's logical .
and he ...
not as i believe -- i think of games , i 'm doing something <unk> .
so he says , that makes you in the sense , because the player can in <unk> achieve more than in real life .
you can in games holds the social ties with each other than in real life . you get more valuable feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently building completely obvious that players are more time in the virtual world as in the real possibility of .
i agree that first time to , it makes sense .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we need to the real world in a game to turn them .
my whole inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years , actually shared .
there are these ancient game , from <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic sketch , there <unk> .
and that were sort of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the mechanics of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> we 're familiar , you know , maybe this story . the story of how and why games are being reinvented .
according <unk> were playing , specifically <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> during a famine , invented .
we think there was such a great famine , that the king of <unk> into a crazy idea i decided that .
the people who suffered . the people fought side .
it was an extreme situation . you took an extremely efficient solution .
so they invented , according <unk> , that <unk> and agreed to a national strategy . in one day would you eat . the next day would you play .
and they were as much in the <unk> would one to be there play , so fascinating and us to satisfying to <unk> productivity now , that you remember that would that 's nothing to eat , there .
and then , the next day would you play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> they survive , so for 18 years that famine , by them on a day ate ravenously and the next was playing .
well , i think , we 're using today , games .
we put play a cell to the suffering from the real world to escape .
we put play a cell to everything to avoid that in the real world 's not work , everything that in real life is no satisfaction is , and we bring us what we need the play .
but that does n't have the end .
that 's exciting .
according <unk> was for 18 years of famine is not better . so i decided to the king , one last <unk> scale-up .
they shared this kingdom , in two halves .

they were leaving <unk> and set out on the lookout for a new home . they were just so many people back out how it food to survive there and we picked up the rest for an area , they are able to .
this sounds crazy , right ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> , the later that comparative rich , trained , the same dna as the old <unk> effectively .
so then the scientists recently to the notion that <unk> . '' this crazy story actually true .
and we geologists thought of evidence of global cooling , the almost 20 years before , what the famine explain .
so i could take these crazy story of voices .
maybe they 're actually their people through play rescued , by now , for 18 years in games , escaped and then this as we had , and so much about this playing with each learned that they get the whole civilization have saved .
so , that we can also .
we 're just since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in real the world of <unk> . this was 16 years ago .
they played for 18 years <unk> , we 're 16 years of warcraft .
i say , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent half of your civilization in the lookout for a new world . so suppose i mean , 21 billion <unk> per week .
we should look at the aarhus convention , that half of us an hour a day with them spend , until we problems in the real world have solved .
i know , they 're going to ask , `` how we 're solving problems of the real world in games ? '' and exactly that question i mean work in the last decade at the center for the future , at one .
we have this banner , in our office in palo alto , it gets out how we the future to understand that .
we do n't want to try to the future , before to say .
what we want , is the future to create .
we want to the best results , imagine . and then people understand how powerful , this idea in the reality to make it .
we ask ourselves epic party , and give people who are , reaching them .
i 'll take a very quickly . three games that i 've designed to try to people that epic party in their own futures get involved .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
this game is by 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , where you a <unk> to get to have .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it for you really going and your real life in fact , without oil life . so , if they 're going to play and register , they tell us , where you live . and then get you <unk> in real , the show you , how much oil costs , what 's not there , like food security is affected is , as transportation of affected by organizations , school closed groups are , whether it was rioting . there and you to figure out how your real life make , if it right now , and we ask them , about to blog , and videos or taking photos your work .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and tested . and we have you ever since over the last three years or outside .
and i can tell you , it was a changing the experience .
nobody wants to life change , because it 's good for the environment is , because we do it should .
but if you 're in epic adventure and were told you get , `` let 's oil . ''
this is a fascinating about adventure , on that you go .
they find out , as you survive in fact , the most of our greatest players have the game <unk> habits by .
so we worked for the next <unk> play a bigger , higher purpose , you 'd rather than just <unk> .
we have this game `` <unk> '' at the center for the future of technology .
starting point is that calculation of a <unk> that the people 's 23 years on planet will we have .
of supercomputers -- called global <unk> <unk> '' of course .
the call the players , they get , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> re-learn .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it 's `` <unk> '' there . you have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and all together , you can save the world .
but in our personal stake , instead of only five million people , we 're saying , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 game played this game , eight weeks for .
they were 500 incredibly creative solutions that you read -- can , if you , `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game , we at 3 . march , and out . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you this game , close to get them from the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> , '' the end by 2010 .
we 're working with the universities in all of sub-saharan africa and they invite one of social <unk> to learn .
we have a comic book on this . we have `` level up '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and ingenuity .
i want you all in order to this game with young people to share , all over the world , particularly in <unk> of them together , they meet their own social enterprises , to imagine , the world to save .
i come to the end .
i want you some questions .
what , you think that happens when the next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that us to know what we can do , but we have the real world 's not now saved .
well , i hope that they told me , there might agree that players are human resources are that we to work in real life can use , and that play a big meaning for transformation did .
we all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , strong social nets to knit , <unk> and that for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we 're actually play games to knock on planet another one way to survive .
and i hope you 're going to me like this game design and play .
if i go on the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things not sure , that we have every <unk> future can create , and that we all kinds of play games .
so i say , let the <unk> games are beginning !
thanks .
i would you like to share something , what i was a few months at writing an article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have to write on my <unk> our questions , but i was the kind of <unk> already done , and i noticed at that i never happened in my life <unk> have , what the word `` the disabled , '' really means .
i read them the post .

<unk> : well , strong , exquisitely sensitive . ''
i have this list of a friend , according to read and the first of laughter , it seemed like this ridiculous , but i was just to `` <unk> '' and i could n't <unk> , and had to stop to read and i 'll just capture for this <unk> <unk> and the time <unk> emotional shock .
obviously there was that a <unk> , old <unk> . i 've told me just thought that the copy 've actually old , you must have .
but actually it was a copy in the early 1980s , when i 'm working with the school actually started and so began to my self outside of the family learning to build and to form , even in terms of other children and the rest of the world around me .
and god was very thankful i did n't <unk> used .
i 'd like this post take seriously , i would be in a world was born , that someone like me as a person to perceive their dignity , whose lives in <unk> way -- has lost it . today , but i 'm going to the opportunity and adventure , that i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately the <unk> of 2009 navigated directly and expecting that i 'm a <unk> 'll find .
there 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , she 's not much better .
those would shock to me the last two words , `` near <unk> '' `` well , '' and `` well . ''
but it 's not just the words .
it 's about , what we think about the people think that we do with these words might suggest .
it 's about the values that in those words pop , and how we these values of constructing weights .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world , and people around us see .
many <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , they actually believed that 's absolutely a <unk> a great force has , because that , what you ca <unk> , they also <unk> can .
so , what we want to actually <unk> -- a <unk> people or a powerful people ?
just over a human <unk> as a child to say , could be enough , they 're not limit , and you very <unk> .
it would not nice , you doors to open up ?
a person , for me out has opened , was my pediatrician in <unk> . chair dupont , the institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , how they can imagine , the most americans do n't be correct the financials tell you could . so he was always , dr. p. called .
and dr. p. was always very colorful packaging around and was the work with kids , just like this .
i found the time that i do in this till they spent some , just great -- the way on my <unk> .
i had given that will be an infinite number of times over again with these big fat , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know how to my <unk> build . and i have this to cut more being vilified as anything else . i 've they hated it . i have you blinding glimpse . i 've they hated it .
and ask them up , i even when it <unk> kid with dr. p. negotiate and so trying to this exercise to stop , <unk> no success .
and one day they got me at one of my favorite exercises at by -- this exercise was really tiring and -- mercilessly -- and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , you 're like a strong , powerful and young girl , you 're going one day one of cut reproductive organs .
and if you do it can , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
it was obviously just a lot easier to trick of dr. p. , so i the exercise i do that i do n't do n't want to the prospect that the richest five-year-old kid in the ward in the second third floor to be . but he got me in fact that brought to my daily <unk> with new eyes to see . so that into a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now , how much of his vision of me as strong and powerful tool that young girl with my self has really shaped and i like being able to me as one of nature of the strong , powerful and <unk> person to see .
this is just an example of many , as adults in <unk> the imagination a child 's the way .
but how are already been quoted examples of the <unk> prove that makes us our language , no room , they do something to imagine , what we all get it would , it to everybody making people to yourself as powerful people to see .
our language is behind the social change after that in many cases , through a technology changes which triggered by .
the medical records from if you can kind of course , say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titanium and put out of <unk> for the aging body , the it allow people , really all their opportunities to use and over the boundaries of you your natural destiny , put it has to figure out to develop , not going to speak of social <unk> platforms , to people into a own identity to build their own way , and so much define , and they do with the world of those who believe that you to choose .
maybe the kind of so this technological change that passes , because we could say that 's been a different truth gave , which is that every man of society as something <unk> and very powerful tool can give and that the human ability to adapt to our biggest , plus is .
the human ability to adapt to be -- that 's an interesting story , because people i kept trying to ask them tell , like me with the odds , i deal , and i 'm going to you something to say , that sentence , has for me never <unk> and i was always very uncomfortable with it felt , the questions of people to be answerable , and i think , gradually i do know , why .
that sentence written by interacting with tremendous odds that lives of the idea that success or fortunately for them depends , a challenge to solving , without the time looking down to experience has to be . as though my life so successful , it makes it , because i the kinds of those of a life with a prosthetic limb of the way could , or how do whatever people to me with my disability to perceive .
but the truth is that we change . course , we are the challenge in fact , no matter whether you physically , emotional , or two is
and i would argue that 's good .
odds are not an obstacle , that we <unk> need to with our lives better clear to come .
odds are just to our lives .
and i tend to think that gave , as my shadow , to see .
sometimes i realize that it 's mind is , sometimes it 's not likely to see , but he 's constantly struggled with me .
and i want to do n't think the impact , or obstruction . the severe head of <unk> a human beings became degrading .
there in your odds , and challenges , and they are just <unk> real , and each person walks with it differently about . but the question is not , whether we do with the odds , i realized then , or not , but how we make sure to come .
so we 're not just responsible for the people who we love , <unk> to maintain , but they also for preparation , well , so clear to come .
and we turn our kids do n't know , if we do you feel that they give it 's not be able to .
you have two things going to separate , first of the medical fact , an to be and to the other the social something about , if i as well , or not .
and actually being , the only real and you 're truly disabling , with the i tell you take previously had to this is that the world , which says , you can see me with definitions that we experience .
in our desire , the people to protect the us at heart of oil and you the cold , being the truth about their medical prediction , to communicate or even a prediction for quality to ask , you are expected , we have an eye , that we 're not the birth to put that somebody actually be disabled .
maybe that 's current policy of the only on attention , what 's in a crash is , and how do we fix , for every single one more of disability than the pathology labs in itself .
if we have a people do n't holistically and treat , and not all its power and opportunity to perceive and who pretends to do in addition to the natural struggle , the you might lead to have to another disease .
we <unk> a human , for our society , a value .
so we have about the <unk> look out and us at all the realm of human possibility to focus .
most importantly , but this is that 's between the perception of pushing and our magnificent ingenuity , a connection there .
we should have this very challenging , you 'd had n't <unk> or in denial , we should n't try to them to avoid , yet we should you among the rug and return , but it 's about , in the odds of opportunity to see it .
it 's me , perhaps more about , clear to ask , that we gave , not about how to have , but that we do that is open , are , you to hug , you end to seize to put them as a <unk> to use , maybe even in order to dance .
and maybe we make it , gave , as a natural , coherent and useful to see , and ourselves in the way through their presence n't like that is burdening them .
this year , and celebration needs to the 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution has written , did darwin , in my view , on something very true in the human nature , pointing out .
i would it 's how we rearrange this : not the most of its species survives , and also not the <unk> its way , but the to the changes it best to be .
of conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work that we know that the ability of people , to survive and <unk> , the clash of human mind , marmite is , around in conflict to turn .
so , again , change and these things are the great skills of people .
and maybe we know , first , from which to wood and we pinched are , if we really 'd be .
maybe this is that 's exactly the sense of the odds , a sense of -- two , a feeling for our own power .
we can be so even something as anything .
we gave a new meaning to be over the tough times beyond all about .
maybe we gave , when you see the change .
he gave stand for a change , at the we have n't have adapted .
i think , the most of damage , the we have a third danger of , is to believe that we normally , should forever .
let 's true -- who is normal ?
there 's not normal .
there 's the usual . this typical . but not the normal . and they would those poor , the gray person who really know how we want , if it they existed ?
i think , actually not .
it would love , if we have this paradigm of normality , by a different the opportunity or the strength to it even a little bit dangerous to proposing to share gps could . so we can the forces of a lot of kids who release , and they 'll invite men , their very specific and theyâ€™d been in the society today .
<unk> they found that we humans from the members of our society , one who claimed that have , useful to be and a contribution to afford .
there 's cues that already the neanderthals , 60,000 years older people and people with severe , physical injuries related to have worn away , and this was perhaps , because the life in <unk> these people for the society value was ,
they have these people not as a broken and useless to look at citarella ; they were different and valuable , treated .
imagine a few years i went into the city , i grew up was , in a <unk> in the `` the red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there was a <unk> tomato .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> .
and i am , a guy behind me , `` well , if that 's not <unk> <unk> is . ''
and i turn the me around and i see these elders man . i had no idea who he is .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , who wants us ? i ca n't look at you remember . ''
and he said , `` well , you may be very well let me remind .
when i do first saw , i was her from the belly of her mother got . ''
oh , so the .
and obviously has it , but then they click .
this was dr. <unk> , a man , the i just like narratives of my mother about this day i knew , because i think of course , quite typical california , to my birthday , two weeks , too late husband came .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was on holiday , so i knew my parents of the man , the me to the world , which , all .
and because i did n't <unk> was born , and my feet , after them pointing to the time and i just a toes in and a few toes , at the other foot , who was the <unk> , these strangers to the bad news in your book .
he said to me , `` i had to your parents say that you never walk , would , and never so <unk> be would like the other children or that you never an independent to live to take this , and since they were able to me simply lying <unk> . ''
really exceptional , i found that it <unk> my entire childhood 's got to matter , if i feel for a <unk> in the second grade , i 'd won , if i had the <unk> in a parade of <unk> out there was , however , if i my transplant fellowship , or one of my <unk> party <unk> had , and he was using these clips to his students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x factor , the potential of human , willing .
you ca n't enough to emphasize , how critical supplies of a factor for the quality of people can be .

you see , dr. <unk> has to think of changes .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone with your , two different things are .
and then i picked my thinking in the course the changed over time , if you to me at age of 15 years , i 'd asked , if i mean prosthetics werenâ€™t actually against the legs of meat and bone or pictures i had , i would have no one second <unk> .
i wanted to the time , which is normal work .
if you to me that today to ask , i 'm not sure .
and this is happening , because i do something with my legs , you 've experienced and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this change that 's also happen , because i was so many people running around a bunch of my door opened them , instead of people to face of me to cut , or me an idea imposing wanted .
you see , it takes a really just a human body of them to demonstrate how their powers <unk> can , and they 're going through .
if you it 's someone making people , his own , inner power to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do that , and for someone in a critical moment a door busts open , then they 're looking for these people a very good teachers .
they bring them in to yourself out to open .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means that anything to bring that in this is , the potential <unk> .
again , which the potential for what we would because now like ?
in the '60s , i was in britain 's a <unk> done . then they <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` nowadays <unk> '' in the united states , we call this as `` <unk> . ''
the students will go into the world .
and the the a student will <unk> harder to pass , get the better teacher , etc .
they 've got about a <unk> period of students with a `` well enough , '' the top grade , `` well , '' there . it was told you , they were <unk> that you very clever would . and after these three months , they really <unk> written .
and of course <unk> 's a heart is to hear that way around the <unk> been told , they were just enough .
and as it was then after the three months , too .
but only ones that 's still in school were -- apart from the students , the school , throwing up .
very crucial in this trial was that the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teachers wo n't know that something changed was .
you did n't just said , that 's be the student and that are the students with the kind enough . and as you have you something about teaching and turn them .
the only real disability is a broken mind is a spirit , the broken by the world , has no hope that anymore . he find nothing more beautiful . he 's our natural , however , curiosity . and our innate capacity of imagination .
if we do it , but eventually , the human spirit of to support to continue to hope to yourself and people around you are finding one of curiosity and <unk> to be then we 're using our power is really positive .
if an untroubled mind about these qualities that does , we can be a new reality and new <unk> do .
i want to a poem end , that inspired by persian poet named <unk> in every century . '' written by and lots of my friend , jacques <unk> told . and this poem called `` the god , the only four words , if you know . '' `` every child knows , not the god the name , not the god is banned , but the god , the only four words , if you know , and these are repeated , he says , only time : come to dance with me . ''
come to dance with me . thank you .
