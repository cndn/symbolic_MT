you know , one of the big <unk> when travel and one of your bliss in the <unk> research is to share with the people to live , the , at the old days you can remember . of your past , still in the wind here , you on the rain <unk> rocks and touch , you in the bitter dregs of the leaves the plants [ taste .
so that know that <unk> still completely beyond the milky way to travel , or the importance of myth the oldest the inuit -- even when you 're getting out there are , or that the himalayas and the buddhists reflect levels still the breath of <unk> tracking , which means , at the root , revelation of physical anthropology research into memory to shout , that 's the idea that the world , we live , not in a total of sense that exists , but just as a model of reality , as a consequence of a group that particular ways of an adaptation of our ancestors , <unk> successful , many generations of chose .
and of course , and what we all the same <unk> .
we 're all born . we teach kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to the <unk> separation from the death of interest and so it should make no surprise that we 'd sing , dancing and and art will be .
but it 's interesting is the unique vocal cadence of <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and plays it does n't matter , whether it around the <unk> in the forests of borneo , is , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior down in <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> right into the sahara . this is by the colleague , and i 'm a month ago in the desert , traveled around . or even a <unk> the hanging of <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us that 's other <unk> , some of thinking , other ways to its house on earth there .
and this is an idea that , if you think about , a with just hope that we can .
together , the <unk> cultures , the world a net of <unk> and cultural life , that the earth is unable , and for is probably the earth as important is the biological <unk> , that you a biosphere does .
you can this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can help when the sum of thoughts and dreams , myths and ideas of inspirations -- and everything that the human imagination ever since the beginnings of consciousness has produced by submarines to be defined .
the <unk> is that big legacy of humanity .
they did this symbol of all of what we 're and what we 're an amazing <unk> species can do .
and just like the biosphere , right away from , they did this with the <unk> -- just to even greater our velocity .
not a biologist , dignity for example , dare to suggest that 50 percent or more all species on the extinct we are , because it does n't come true . and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> on the area of biological diversity -- which is hardly at what we as <unk> <unk> on the area of cultural diversity , known .
and the key phenomenally useful for that is extinct in the languages .
than any of them in this room was born , were on earth are 6,000 different languages spoken .
now is a language not the totality of the vocabulary belongs , or a series of <unk> .
a language is the expression of human spirit .
she 's a means to the soul of a certain cultures have access to the material world finds oneself .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , an inflection point , a thought , an ecology of spiritual and opportunities .
and of that are 6,000 different languages are today , as we 're here in monterey , sit , exactly half of no longer in the ears of children <unk> .
they 're infants do n't have taught . that means if not being done , they 're actually been dead .
what might be lonely be , as the silence , unable to be one of the past your people back to be that your language to talk , no way to have to the wisdom of the ancestors of science , or a hopeful that kids to expect that ?
and yet , stamp this horrible fate of somebody somewhere on earth , about . all the two weeks , because of two weeks to die an older -- and take the last <unk> an old language to be the grave .
and i know that some of you say , it 's not just as ? '' was the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to talk to be ? '' and i 'm saying , '' well , like this language , yoruba . let you <unk> be .
let you kogi . ''
and then you were suddenly realize how it would , if your own language not could talk .
so i 'd you today , on a journey through the <unk> take away , a quick voyage through the <unk> to try to you get to do , which actually been lost .
now there are among us , the way , forget that i , when i say different ways of being , '' truly different ways of being mean .
take them for example , this child the <unk> in the northwest of the amazon , the people the <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from east around the belly of latter-day saints , snakes <unk> .
this is a people , which is not being cognitively far between the colored blue , and green is different , there 's <unk> the forest , from where people depend on , <unk> is .
they have a dip language and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> is called , you have to marry someone , another language , talks .
this all grounded in the mythological past . that appear on this big houses , where mistakes because of the <unk> six or seven languages spoken to be , but what is that you would n't somebody said , that one learned language .
you hear about to and start to go to talk .
or , one of the <unk> tribes , with whom i ever have lived , the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first came back in 1958 , peaceful and i contacted by the world .

they threw a new photographs of themselves from the air down , what we as kind , gesture to think would . out toward you that these people from the rainforest in your life never heard something <unk> had seen .

but the <unk> killed , not only be the spear .
they <unk> at each other .
54 percent of the deaths that happened through <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations go back and found two of a natural death and when we do people with very forcibly , something about <unk> , you gave them , that one of the people that old , has been that he 's based on its different ages , died , and we would kill him still with the spear .
but while they had a clear -- knowledge of forests , the amazing .
they think of hunters who were the urine of an animal 's from 40 to go away you smell and then , to which species , this was .
in the early <unk> years , i was quite an amazing job , when i was my professor in the harvard , he said , if i can be interested , in haiti , to go and the secret societies to infiltrate the the bedrock of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> was and the venom , that this was used to <unk> to do , sure .
about this wide a sense to give you had , i want something about this really think of <unk> know , and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
in the opposite , , it 's about a complex <unk> world .
it 's interesting .
if i ask her dignity , the major world length of what they would say ?
christianity , islam , in buddhism , <unk> or whatever .
a continent will always leave out , because the presumption , was that , it in sub-saharan africa is n't religious faith to give him . course there was a and <unk> is just the remnant of these very <unk> religious thought that during the tragic diaspora , the <unk> <unk> .
but what <unk> so interesting , is this is a relationship between the living and the dead .
the living give the spirits .
the spirit can of them under the whole lot of evoking going to respond to the rhythm of the dance to the soul of living in this temporarily leaving out to , so that the <unk> for a short shiny time to god will .
cram say the <unk> like , `` your white going to the church , and talking about god .
we use dancing in the temples , and going to god . ''
and because you might say , you get the mind is not taken . how you damage the third danger going ?
you see these amazing -- demonstrations , <unk> in a <unk> , the hot and coal , without lessening mine <unk> , an amazing graph of the ability of mind the body like to shape that it <unk> , if it in a state of extremes of state and then they will .
now , of all of people that i 've met , were kind of kogi does the sierra nevadas , will give up santa <unk> in <unk> , the most exceptional .

in a <unk> continent , were these people are the only , the end of the <unk> conquered were .
to present day , they become a ritual that priesthood is king . the training to that priesthood , but it really extraordinary .
the young <unk> be the age of three and four years of their families , separate and in a <unk> world , the dark , in <unk> she was a fab the glacier , for 18 years really , two periods of each , nine years , deliberately chose to the nine months of pregnancy , suddenly , the in her lap , they helped her mother to contribute to spend them now <unk> in her lap , the great parent .
and during this whole period , they are culturally in the value in their society in place . values that the claim sustain that their prayer , and just your prayers of the cosmic scene -- or we can say that be profitable asset -- figuring out to be decreased .
but at this amazing <unk> they become one day , suddenly i went out in fact , and i first in your life , at age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this <unk> moment of consciousness of the first of light , if the sun is starting on the <unk> the astonishingly beautiful place to b rays , is becoming suddenly everything , what they in abstract 've learned in scale of grandeur confirmed . and the priests and you 're going back and says , `` you see ? it 's really , as i do you 've .
it 's so wonderful . you have it to protect . ''
they are older brother and say that we have that we are younger brother who are , for the destruction of the world , accountable .
now this level of intuition is very important .
and if we of aboriginal and the landscape of thinking , <unk> we 're either <unk> and the old lady who of fancy , wild up , which is in his simplification a <unk> idea is , or other thoreau and say , these people are more with the natural connection , when we .
so , some indigenous groups are n't sentimental , there are you of nostalgia , otherwise ill .
it 's still not much space for the <unk> swamps of <unk> or the cold twist of tibet , you have , but nevertheless , through time and the ritual a mysterious <unk> the world shaped , not on the idea is based , you very close to be , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth , just existing technology can , because they 're in human consciousness is <unk> .
now , which means that ?
it means that a little kid from the andes , in the belief that grows up , that the mountain in a <unk> is , the title or her destiny , then , is a very different person will , and a different relationship to this resource , or this place that have , as a little kid from montana , in the belief that grows up to be a mountain under a bunch of stone is , washing away , can be .
if he had a location of mind or a bunch <unk> is , is irrelevant .
this interesting is the metaphor , which the relationship between the individual and the nature is defined .
i grew up in the woods by british columbia and i believed that these forests that there are , <unk> to be .
it made me to a different people as my friends in the <unk> , who believe that these forests of the abode of <unk> and the curved <unk> and the <unk> minds are the <unk> the world where , righteous minds of them on their <unk> participate in fact .
now , if you start to the idea of looking at that these cultures , various new realities , which can , you some of their extraordinary discoveries to understand . for example this plant here .
it 's a picture , that i just last april , in the northwest of the amazon , where we had .
this is <unk> of the whole lot of you 've heard , the most sorts preparation for the repertoire of the shamans live .
what <unk> so fascinating , you 're not only is that <unk> potential that <unk> , but of processing . it gets really from two different sources of them . the one hand , there are these wooden <unk> , the number of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , slightly hallucinogenic , to . this <unk> by taking that 's about as though , a blue <unk> smoke at your mind off , it 's , but with the leaves a <unk> from the family , the <unk> the name <unk> <unk> together .
this plant which includes some very strong <unk> the serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar situations .


it 's no distortion of reality is , but the resolution of reality .
i have even with my professor , richard grant <unk> , the man , the psychedelic <unk> with the discovery of the magic fungi in mexico in the <unk> years , humble technology has to be discussing . i said , that you <unk> not as hallucinogenic categorize it was able to go into the moment where you the implications for creativity , you do n't there is to a <unk> to experience .
but the thing with <unk> is the that they do n't <unk> be obtained can , because they 're a in the human gut , <unk> enzyme that with names <unk> , <unk> be .
you can only in conjunction with some of different chemicals <unk> be obtained , the mao <unk> .
now it 's fascinating that the <unk> , in the <unk> which are , <unk> of exactly the way that are , the necessary is to the <unk> to <unk> . you ask yourself so reversing themselves .
how can these people from a <unk> by 80,000 species <unk> plant these two , morphologically just not adding these plants and find that , if this way , combined , a kind of <unk> version of creating , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts is ?
we use these great euphemism to try and error , as being meaningless -- turns out .
but he asks you the native americans tell you , `` the plant is talking to us . ''
so , which means that ?
this tribe , the <unk> , of 17 different varieties of <unk> that they all the great distance in the forest is recognizing that for our eyes , as a kind of sand appear .
and then ask them , like your taxonomy both create and they say , i thought , you understand something of plants .
i mean , you know anything ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns out that you 're all the 17 more in <unk> absolute and they sing to a in a different <unk> .
so , that gives them not a ph.d. in the harvard , but it 's more interesting than <unk> to count .
well , this <unk> problem is that even those of us , the concerns the difficult for the native americans have to them as <unk> and colorful , look , you but somehow the past your detriment , during the world , which our world , progresses .
so , the fact is that you look at the 20th century . , in 300 years , not for his terrorist war or technological innovation will remember , but rather than at an era , we <unk> was and the massive destruction of biological and cultural diversity here on earth 's either way to make or a passive and rethinking weight . so this problem is not the change .
all cultures have to turn on the dance with new <unk> involved .
and this problem is not the technology in itself .
the <unk> and they had no less on the sioux , to be as you a bow , and the arrow did , as the americans who stopped americans to be , when you a horse and <unk> tasks .
do n't change and technology could threaten the integrity of <unk> . it 's power . that ugly face the rule .
and where do whatever you the world <unk> , you will discover that these cultures are not the positions of <unk> . these are completely alive because people , whose existence through the visible very much , that 's the about their capacity of these things beyond . whether it out to the vast logging in the country of the <unk> is , a <unk> from asia , of <unk> , a people , that was a generation freely in the forest , living , and now to <unk> , prostitution , the river <unk> was , from where you can see that even the river with mud , polluted by , almost half of borneo , in the <unk> sea <unk> seems . of where the japanese <unk> at it to see are , are willing to their <unk> with the raw <unk> to fill that you the forest away , or as in the case <unk> , where it <unk> are , during the <unk> <unk> were .
or if we in the mountains of tibet , where i <unk> much work , you do that ugly face the political and dominance .
you know , the genocide that <unk> extinction of people 's kind of the world , but the <unk> , the destruction of the way of the people , will not only do n't care system , but generally , and <unk> a <unk> celebrated .
and you can 's suffering <unk> n't understand , if you do n't it on <unk> that we have seen .
and i went suddenly engage with a young colleagues are 6,000 of miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> through <unk> after <unk> and only when i went <unk> came , i saw the face the statistics of which you hear . 6,000 holy monuments , the rubble , and ash into them . 1.2 million people that during the cultural revolution of the <unk> killed were .

that meant that it during the chinese invasion immediately get killed by the world .
his uncle '' bug living with their sanctity of the diaspora , people for nepal and brought them .
his mother was locked up , than lenient punishment and for -- for the crime as wealthy to be .
he was the age of two years in the prison smuggled to be under your <unk> to hide , because they did n't live in anything .
the sister , of these <unk> did <unk> , was in a <unk> brought them .
one day , she looks kind of a tags <unk> and for these <unk> she had for seven years in a 400-pound electroencephalogram , labor .
this suffering <unk> can seem unbearably be , but the <unk> spirit of people 's something <unk> .
and the end we are really have a choice . we 've set in a <unk> world of <unk> or in a <unk> world of diversity of life ?
margaret mead , the great . anthropologist who said before they died , that 's their greatest fear is , while we 're in towards a thread , <unk> , generic world move , we 're not just the whole range of human imagination at a <unk> way you can fly would see , but that one day we took a dream up , and i 've forgotten to think it ever the other ways , there .
and it 's really humbling to remember thinking that our species , perhaps been over 600,000 years longer exists .
the <unk> revolution , us the agriculture has introduced , and us that moment , the cult of <unk> <unk> , the poetry of the shamans live video-feed through the purple prose the priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and the surplus , created -- i found was just 10,000 years , happened .
the modern industrial world as we 're used is hardly see 300 years old .
well , these superficial history tells me not that we all the answers to the challenges have , we 're in the next few millennia , to them are .
if we these <unk> <unk> after the importance of human questions , it got them with 10,000 various voices .
and in this song , we become the ability to rediscover that being , what we are , people with into consciousness , the fact , the importance are aware that all people and gardening , a space , are being able to <unk> to . and there 's great moments of the optimism .
here 's a picture , that i at the north end of <unk> had taken , when i do with <unk> on the <unk> went . and this man , <unk> , told me a wonderful story of his <unk> .
the canadian government is not always very familiar with the inuit usage , and during the <unk> years in the course the establishment of our regime , they were forced me , settlements , to move .
the grandfather of this old man who refused to be .
the family , the fear for his life was , i took him all of guns and all the tools .
now have you know that the inuit -- not afraid on the cold , they used them their benefit .
the <unk> their <unk> were created originally from fish , in <unk> wrapped this is now , created .
the grandfather of man 's worried that they 're not on the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> went out , let his pants down from <unk> down and <unk> in his hand . and as the feces to market started , shaped , he told them in the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> saliva and the sides of <unk> and when it completely frozen was , <unk> he 's a dog that .

so you can take nothing to do something .
and this is in many ways a symbol of the resistance of the inuit -- and all indigenous peoples in the world .
the canadian government had the inuit -- in april 1999 , the complete control over an area again , that 's bigger than california , texas .
it 's our new home country , and i mean <unk> .
it 's an independent area . they control all <unk> .
an amazing example , as a nation , a state of atonement with its people , that we search and i can accomplish .
and ultimately , i think , it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us , the to be making targeting the earth , across are , to realize that you do n't get away .
they are the <unk> of someone .
they represent the parts of the human imagination , the in times past back . and for all of us to be the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children of geography of hope .
what we at national geographic survey after all trying to is that we believe that i 've never achieve something .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> no conclusive , is , but we believe that storytelling and the world can change and so we 're probably the best institution for storytelling in the world . our website , 35 million popular ones transmitted every month .
156 nations to send our tv .
our science magazines can be a million people reading .
and we take a series of travel in the <unk> , in which we are our audience to places of such as cultural and amazed to take that she 's lots of that looked at , are blinded , and hopefully , they become one after the other the root , revelation of physical anthropology , suppose : that this world 's made this has , on different ways to exist , that we have a <unk> in a very multicultural <unk> world can find , in the wisdom of all people to our shared and well-being we can contribute .
thank you .
i do first , as quickly as possible , going to show is the fundamental work , a new technology that we microsoft a <unk> ago exactly one year , who have . this is <unk> . and it 's an environment , in either you locally , right away with huge amount of visual information can deal .
we see many , the information about digital photographs here , that you would blend seamlessly , and its <unk> , pan , at any way we arranged can .
and it 's no matter , how many of information we look , how large that collections that are or how big the images are .
the most of you 're digital photos as a camera , but this is for example , a scan of the hyperbolic , and it 's a domain of 300 <unk> .
it does n't matter , because the only , what the performance of the system like this is constrained can , is the number of a pixel in your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible , architecture .
this is a whole book , an example for <unk> .
this is <unk> house of <unk> . every column , is a chapter .
to prove that there must be really a text and not a picture is , we can be about how do that , to really show that 's an actual representation of <unk> and not an image is .
maybe this is an artificial kind of a <unk> to read .
i would it does n't recommend .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that gives you really the pleasure and the good experience a real <unk> a magazine , or a newspaper to read , which is , a kind of medium with several scales .
we also something on the corner of these special edition of the guardian did .
we have a false earlier this with very high setting designed that much higher than with a good ad is , and we 've added on added .
if you the functions car that look like , they can see here .
or some models , or even add to <unk> .
and this grabs me tell these ideas on , these constraints of the goal is tied on screen aimed at .
we hope that no pop-ups and other being more mean -- that should n't need to be .
obviously this is mapping of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i 'd like this really not much time playing video , except to say that we also to this area contribute to be .
but these are all roads in the united states .
<unk> at the top <unk> picture at nasa .
let 's see now something else out .
now this is actually live in the internet . you can it <unk> .
this is a project with the name <unk> that 's really two different technologies together .
the one is <unk> and the other is a very good primate research about <unk> , the story <unk> , a <unk> the university of washington , under the advice from steve <unk> at the <unk>
and rick <unk> from microsoft has done before . a very good working together .
so this is live in the internet . it will of <unk> driven .
you can see that , if we see this kind of views of creating , in which we 're taking pictures through , can and that experience the experiences deserved to do .
but the brain that distribution of imagery is here in fact that of meaning .
the <unk> have these pictures together , lasted so you the real space , where those images of all in near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian rockies , were made a reminder . you see pieces of stabilized slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in perspective in the relationship with each other , fire .
i 'm not sure , if i time still have you very different environments to show .
there 's what a lot of spatial .
i wanted to look straight one of the original pieces of the story to show and this is from early prototype of <unk> at the first time in summer , and they have to give you to do this , what i think it 's really the kicker is behind this technology , the <unk> is . and this is not so obvious , if you the environments , look at that we 're on the website .
we had to us all the lawyers , etc . they need to do .

so they 're all of this <unk> , and they all of space that way in the relationship with each other .
and we can look at this very simple way to navigate .
. you know , i never believed that i end up at microsoft 're going .
i 'm very thankful for the <unk> here .
. i suspect , you can see that this many different kinds of cameras are , is all of the <unk> to professional <unk> , a pretty large number of them , the all in this environment me were .
and when they can , i 'm going to some of the strange way .
many of you 're of their faces , with , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- there are you .
this is actually a poster of notre dame , that i 've been recorded by the world .
we can of the poster to a physical or this environment over .
the point is here , that we do with the social environment , and then you can . it will now data from all the 10 years -- the whole collective of memory of how to do with the planet looks -- and everything is connected .
all these photographs are connected , and there will be something that 's bigger than the sum of the parts .
you get a model that from around the earth , and here .
so much as you see this as the sequel of labor of stephen <unk> of virtual earth .
and this is something that through the complexity , with the people use it , growing and its use the user , with the app is always gets bigger .
their own photos are going to have metadata <unk> , the another person has entered .
if they got the trouble has done and all that saint of them have and <unk> , who they 've all , and it 's my photo of the notre <unk> suddenly , with all these data , held and i can do when i started using the stage in this space to dive , in this <unk> , the photos of the other people use and so a kind of <unk> <unk> social experience with the use of the other players doing .
and of course , the byproduct of which are very rich , virtual models of any interesting part of earth , are not just by <unk> or a satellite and so on keeping separations were , but through collective of memory .
thank you .
. i do know you right ? their software that allows that to a certain point , within the next few years , all images , the of someone in the world together to be used in principle actually connected to be ?
yes . she does nothing more than finding out .
if you want to put them to hyperlinks , between the slides .
and she does this based on the content in the slides .
and this is really exciting , if you look at the amount of semantic information i think of a lot of those images have .
as if you a <unk> for images make , where they are each enter and the lyrics of the webpage has a lot of information about , which is a picture is .
but how would it , if this picture of them with all been linked together ?
then is the circumference of semantic <unk> and the amount that they get , really . it is a classic <unk> .
<unk> , which is pretty incredible , congratulations .
they 're very much .
i 'm going to you some things from my book about the way that i hope , in unison with other things are you have heard . and i 'm trying to a couple of connections to create , if you this is n't have noticed .
i want to start with , what i said to the official dogma binding . '' i call .
the official dogma of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized societies .
the official dogma binding on either way , if our goal is to maximize coverage of civic our government is , is this was mostly through the <unk> the freedom of individuals .
the reason for this is , the liberty in itself is good , valuable to make sense , a <unk> requirement for the human .
if human freedoms that we have , then it 's all of us for itself around the things to do that our common good to maximize and nobody has given us to decide .
the way of freedom to maximize that 's a choice to maximize coverage .
more choices , people have to go beyond the freedom of them . and as the freedoms they have to go to , more common good did you .
this is , i think , so deep in our water , ones that 's never wavered in the sense to get it would questions .
and it 's also deeply in our lives runs .
i 'm going to you some examples of that to give us through modern made possible .
this is my supermarket . not much .
i 'd just about <unk> say .
there 's probably 175 <unk> in my local supermarkets , if you the 10 different category <unk> n't <unk> and 12 <unk> that they go up to a large number of their own , lettuce <unk> make some of on a tale case , no idea that the 175 cases in the shop for you right .
so this is how the supermarket .
and then they 're going to the <unk> business strategy for a good stereo at an -- some speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , it 's imagination-amplifier . and in this one of electronics in , there 's how many <unk> facilities .
we can <unk> millions of <unk> 'd put out of the components that in a business are offered .
you must admit that a large selection is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there was a time , as i was a boy was , because you could every phone on the you wanted , as he of an ma bell who came .
they have your phone <unk> . you have n't it <unk>
a consequence of this was that the phone ever broken .
these days are over .
we 've now almost an infinite variety of your phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
these are your cellphones , the future .
and my favorite is the in the center -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> torch around .
and they to that until now not in your business and i 've seen , you can be sure that she 's going to be .
and what it does is it brings people get in the business to walk and this question to ask .
you know now what the answer that question is ?
the answer is `` no . ''
it 's not possible a phone to buy , that 's not too much does .
in other aspects of life , the very far more important than the purchase of objects we 're going to hit the same explosion of choices too .
health -- it 's no longer the case in the united states that you to the doctor , and the doctor says you what to do .
instead they 're going to the doctor and the doc 's telling you : why we have a to make or we could imagine doing .
a , has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what you want to do ?
and they say , `` doctor , what should i do ? ''
the doctor says , `` i got these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you i would , doc , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not you . ''
the result is -- we call it patient , autonomy . '' in this sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift the burden of responsibility for the meeting of decisions of someone could n't know -- namely the doctor -- to explore the n't know , and likely that 's ill and why not in the best constitutional proposition is a decision to meet -- namely the patient .
there 's such a marketing is <unk> drug for people like you and me , that , if you think about , no sense of power , because we do n't buy .
why do gears for them around us , if we 're not able to buy ?
the answer is : you expect of us the doctor in the next morning to call and to a change the prescription to ask .
something so profound as our identity is now an issue of choice , like this slide show you want .
we inherit not an identity , we make them .
and we reinvent ourselves as often by how we want .
that means that every day , if you the morning , wake up , you to decide , what a kind of the person you can be like .
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time , in the <unk> was that , almost every one had and the way you get married soon as you could , and so fast as children were as you could .
the only true that election was `` who '' to do n't know when , and not what they keep doing .
nowadays everything is easy to have .
i 'm teaching at the intelligent students , and i 'll give you 20 percent less effort and when i once did .
and that 's not because they 're less sense are , and not because they are more carefully .
it 's because you with other things are engaged , you ask yourself , `` i have to marry , or not ? should i 'm going to marry ?
i have to come to marry ? should i just have kids , or just been doing ? ''
who are all <unk> questions .
and they are these questions , regardless of that if that means that all the tasks to make the news i seeking and no good note in my class of wars .
and in fact that they to do that . these are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we 're blessed , as carl schoonover shows that has the technology that allows us every minute of every day of any place on planet to work -- the way on the <unk> hotel .
there are actually a corner of the whole thing i 'm not going to tell , in the <unk> works .
i 'm going to it did n't want to tell , because i use it wants .
so what it , this incredible freedom of choice we have in terms of choices to meet , and again , and again , whether we work should or not working alongside much .
we can make our kids for soccer game , watching , and we have our mobile phone in a hip , and your blackberry , in other hip , and our laptop is probably going on your lap .
and even if you all off , are , every minute , in our child , <unk> a soccer watching . we ask ourselves as well , `` i should this call would ?
i tried to this email back ? i should devote this letter writing ? ''
and even if the answer to the question `` no , '' is that 's certainly affecting their experience of <unk> their children <unk> very different than it would ever .
everywhere , where we look closely , great things and little things , material stuff and lifestyle , life is an issue of choice .
and the world , we lived , he looked like .
so i want to say , there are choices , but not it was an issue of choice .
and the world , we now live looks like .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is `` aye . ''
we all know what good thing is , so i 'll talk about what i think about this is .
all these choices we have two effects , two or negative effects on people .
an effect , <unk> way , this is that he paralyzed , instead of free .
with so many options out of the you choose to make it 's people very hard at all to decide .
i 'm going to them another one <unk> example of this kind of a study about investing in private voluntary <unk> .
a colleague of me had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of like one million u.s. employees and so here . 2000 , so different jobs .
and what they found was brought 10 <unk> of employers who offered to go through the part in order of living off .
they 're offering 50 <unk> on -- 10 percent fewer people taking part of as if you just five to provide more dignity . why ?
because it 50 <unk> are , the selection are , it 's so hard to decide what you choose to that they do it on the morning procrastinating .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's obviously never .
you understand that 's not just means that people <unk> need to eat when you in the retirement , because they 're not enough money for a nine-second quarter of , it also means that you 'll make this hard is that they 're <unk> your employers who miss .
by the not participating . give them up to know , the u.s. dollars per year on the future employer , the lucky to have been to their contributions to reproduce .
paralysis , is a consequence of too many options .
and i think it 's worried that the world looks like .
they like the decision really well , if it for all eternity is , right ?
they do n't want the wrong investment chucking a vote , or even the <unk> .
so this is an effect . the other side effect is that even if we the lesion of breaking and make a decision , we end we have less happy with the result of the selection , as , if we the opportunity had had kind of us between any opportunity to decide .
and there 's several reasons for this .
one of them is reduced by the large selection of different <unk> , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and , which <unk> 's been perfect necklace ? it 's easy to imagine that she 's another decision , they can meet the better would ever . and what happens is this is that <unk> alternative which causes them , they 're in the decision to regret , and that we regret that they make a negative impact on the average happiness that you of their impacts the decision to the time , even if it 's a good choice .
more opportunities there , the less simpler and it 's anything to regret that 's a letdown . for the choice that they meet .
secondly , what economists <unk> call .
dan , gilbert 's got a big point where the morning , made by was telling how much of the way , we evaluate things , of it depends on to do it 's compare .
well , if it 's lots of alternatives to think there , it 's easy , attractive characteristics of one of alternatives that they exclude from that makes them less happy with the alternatives that you who have .
here 's an example . for the of them , the no new york are , apologize for me .
but here is , what they 're thinking about all .
here 's a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous , the beach . great day . you have it 's all for themselves .
what could be better ? `` damn ! '' the man who thinks , `` it 's august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood , is gone .
i could in front of my house park . ''
and he spend two weeks of the thought that tracks that he the opportunity where you have , the day about the day , a great parking lot of law .
<unk> reduce the average happiness that we by our choice about this is , well , if that what we chose to have a fantastic .
and more opportunities -- it on the choice , there , some more attractive properties of choices be in the <unk> into consideration .
here 's one another example .
now , this cartoon pictures made some statements .
he makes a statement about the now , your life , but i think about things start to do .
but an important point , the he does is , and how you look for one thing to decide whom decide they are other things not to do .
and these other things like many , attractive properties have , and it 's what you 're going to do that are more appealing to do .
three : <unk> the expectations .
this has i met , when i mean for me to share that i wanted .
i 'm jeans , almost all the time .
and there was a time in it just for me a kind there , and they actually bought , and you feel bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if you long enough that carried out and often enough clean up , they started , `` ok . '' <unk> .
so i was about new me to buy after many years of <unk> the old , and i said , `` i 'd like a couple of me , here 's my size . ''
and the sales , `` you want to risk , slightly <unk> or the ocean ?
you want to do buttons , or <unk> ? rock or an acid would clean ?
you want to me with holes ?
want them down from where we cut , <unk> , blah ... '' and so he told .
my jaw was down and after i started rebounding , i said , `` i 'd like the kind of the past the only way . ''
he had no idea what this was , so i spent an hour with all these up for me to <unk> , and spread the deal -- and i say the truth -- with the best put me that i ever did .
i did it better . all these choices that allowed it me it better have them .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try it myself to understand .
the reason for that i got worse , i felt was , with all this available social choices , my fondest hopes for , what a good for me to go to go upstairs .
i had very low expectations . i did not a concrete expectations , as it you just in a kind there .
when you in a hundred species that came to damn , one of you would be perfect should forever ,
and what i got was good , but it was n't perfect .
and so i compared to what i 'll have had to the what i expected , and what i was a letdown . in comparison to the what i expected .
this add of opportunities in the life people increases that inevitably the expectations of people are about how well these opportunities to be .
and this leads to any satisfaction to the results , even when the results are good .
nobody in the world of marketing manager knows this . because , if you it would , you know what they 're not what it 's .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is , that used everything was better than anything worse that was , than anything worse it was it into the people can see these things to make the a pleasurable surprise them .
now , in the world , we live -- we live , the industrialized citizens , to perfection , as an expectation -- the best for that you ever more than it 's the things are so good about how it of you expect .
you 'll never put into our surprise , because your expectations , my fondest hopes , <unk> .
the secret to the conditions -- this is what they did we are -- that secret to the conditions are , have an expectation .
i 'd say -- a little <unk> moment -- that i do with a wife annie perasa married am , and she 's really quite wonderfully .
i would do it does n't do better . i do n't culturing bacteria .
but they preferred that 's not always like a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of <unk> one thing sitting right for me if it only one way to buy there is that if you that way are , and they 're wondering why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different types of me to see that are , and they buy one of anticlimactic . is , and they 're wondering why , who is responsible for ?
it 's also clear that the answer to the question is , you .
they would be better , can do .
to 100 different kinds of me to the windows , there 's no excuse for error .
and so , when people make decisions , and even if you the results make decisions are good , they feel keenly disappointed about , you being themselves .
clinical depression , exploded in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think a pose -- not the only , but a pose <unk> to this explosion of depression and then committing suicide , this is that people who 've learned of anticlimactic . are because their standards , are so , and then , when they get these experiences himself who have , you think it would your fault .
and this is <unk> that 's us , generally better than happy , objective , and we 're bad feeling .
so let me take you remember .
this is the official dogma , this one that we all the right now , completely false . it 's not true .
there 's no question , that some selection is better than not , but it is not , that more selection is better than a choice .
there 's a magical lot . i do n't know what it 's .
i 'm pretty sure that we this point of time where you have the sample of our common good way .
now , as a policy question -- i 'm getting ready to -- as a policy question , the thing about the thinking . that 's all these choices to be sitting in the industrialized societies , is the material that wealth .
there are many places in the world , and we have of a lot of you 've heard about to the problem is not the too large selection is .
your problem is that she 's good enough to have .
so the things about the i 'm telling you 're an odd problem of the modern , rich , as those societies .
and what is so incredibly frustrating and angry , is : steve levitt would have to yesterday about reddit tells how this is more and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i 'm telling you is that expensive , complicated decisions -- it 's not easy , that they do n't help .
they do in fact that hurts .
they worry about it that we got worse , standing there .
if something from what the people of our own way these decisions to come to the societies where people to make choices we 've shifted their dignity , would not just the life people struggling , but we would also be improved .
economists call this one <unk> application .
<unk> going to worry that everybody 's better than that 's not just the poor -- because all these large selection of us , overcrowded meetings .
finally , read you ask this cartoon , and , evolved subsets of the person , says , `` ah ! what have this fish ?
you know it 's not possible in this <unk> . ''
<unk> imagination , a shortsighted , from the world -- and that 's the way i do it first you 've read .
as i but i thought about , some more i came to the view , that the fish do you know .
because the truth is that if you that <unk> break , so that it 's possible , you have no freedom . they have a lesion .
if you that <unk> break , so that it 's possible to reduce her the average happiness .
you increase of paralysis and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost to complete security to be limited -- perhaps even the fish , definitely upward for us .
but that <unk> be a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for likewise , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i talked about some of these projects are already been talking , over the genome and what that could mean , and over the discovery of new tool groups of genes .
actually start to a new point , we have the biology and digitized , and now we try the digital code in a new phase of biology to go through our new life create , and build .
we have been trying to great questions to ask .
what 's life ? it 's something , what i believe that many biologists have tried to understand and this on different levels .
we have different approaches tried to it up on the minimum , wetware to simplify it .
we have nearly 20 years of digitized . when we that <unk> have sequenced it was at the transition from analog world of biology to digital world that the computer .
now we 're trying to be asking whether we live regenerate can or whether we new life are able to figure out of this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , the mycoplasma <unk> , the smallest genome of a species has some of yourself in the lab that replicate it . and we tried to see if we do it with an even smaller genome , you can achieve .
we 've done it on about a hundred genes to get rid of the 500 , or something that i 'm here .
but if we those metabolic map , look , the very simple is , in comparison to our own . you can trust me , this is simple . but if we all those genes to look at the we one after the other , eliminating needless to make it 's very unlikely that this to a living cell and take their dignity .
so we 've determined that 's the only way in front is that chromosome in fact , to synthesize , allowing us the individual elements to <unk> and so a couple of the fundamental question to ask .
and so we started with the question , we can a chromosome , synthesize that ?
this , it the chemistry that really big nano-molecular molecules to create what you 've never been done ?
and , if we can do that , we can that chromosome , they start ?
a chromosome , is the way , just a piece <unk> chemical material .
our first steps at the digitization , of life -- exponentially .
our ability of genetic code to write has very slowly up , but nevertheless , increased . and our last point would go on an exponential curve down .
we 've got 15 years ago started .
it took actually a few years , starting with a <unk> review , before we the first experiments that thing .
it turns out is <unk> very difficult .
there are tens of machines , around the world 's the little pieces of dna can manufacture of 30 to say they 're like this one , but it 's a <unk> process , so ever made a piece of power , the more error is happening .
so we had a new way to develop the we are those pieces together and the error correct way .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , of the genome that phi x 174 countries .
it 's a little swept the bacteria , kill .
we created little pieces , did a <unk> and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting time , when we did this piece <unk> chemical engineering and in a bacterium , gave me , and this bacterium that began the genetic code to read and went viral particles .
the viral particle charges were then the cells up and they came back and killed , e. coli .
recently i 've got the <unk> spoke and they said that you this model just figure out .
they were laughing , more than their it 's doing .
so we think that 's a situation is in the software in fact that your hardware we can build a biological systems .
but we wanted a lot more to go . we want a whole <unk> chromosome out . it has more than <unk> ability to be genetic code . so we thought , we build it in equipment of the size of bumpy-looking virus , what we the size of equipment <unk> were able to understand what the individual elements of a living cell .
design is the key , and if you with digital information in the computer to start to have these digital access information is pretty accurate .
when we the genome for the first in 1995 , have sequenced it was the <unk> at a mistake per 10,000 pairs .
we found at <unk> 30 mistakes . if we the original sequence , they would it would never been possible <unk> .
a part of design is it , will have to create the 50 letters for are and the lenses with <unk> pieces overlap . need to get smaller <unk> to build with these together .
we have a unique elements there is built .
you might have heard that we <unk> inside that have .
you think about : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> these letters -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino ; and there 's a single digit -- for each of these amino acids .
so we can the genetic code using about our words to to write sentences , thoughts .
and then we only signed .
some people who were being that it 's not have poetry was .
we have the pieces of the way where that we 're just to enzymes , break up . there are enzymes are this repair and to stitch back .
and we 've started will have to create , starting with pieces of the five to <unk> characters in terms , added these people to <unk> to take this back together , to <unk> .
in every step we have these pieces in the surplus produced by that we 're sequencing , we could , because we tried a very robust process to create what they were in a minute , will see .
we tried to the period of <unk> to go .
so , that looks like a <unk> .
if we wanted to the right on the largest pieces of going -- with over 100,000 pairs -- then they are not just in the chuck e. coli that grow . it 's way beyond all possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so well let 's another place to .
we know what is a mechanism of <unk> recombinations to call this is going to be the biology is used to disrupt dna to repair of these pieces together can .
here 's an example of them . there 's an organism function called <unk> <unk> the three million cycle of radiation , fine .
you see in the upper field , that be a chromosome , just unpack that fell .
it go up 24 hours later , has everything again , so uneasily together as it was .
we have thousands of organisms do that can .
these organisms that can totally <unk> be , you can even in a vacuum life .
i 'm totally certain that live in space that exists and they can move , the lookout for <unk> conditions .
indeed , the nasa has shown that 's lots of them out there are .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we 've created by we these things have used in fact , we only <unk> used to the right design the pieces we have you <unk> . yeast and more food and then automatically .
this is not <unk> it 's a regular micrograph .
so it 's a big molecule that we do it even with <unk> can see .
that are taken over a whole duration of six seconds .

that are about <unk> characters at hiding the code . it 's the largest molecule to <unk> structure that have dreamed of people who was created .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we about a <unk> of 10 and without the distances plot them what would it <unk> sides to embrace , just about this genetic code <unk> .
now , how to start to a chromosome 7 ? how we activate it ?
obviously this is that it with a virus , very simple . it is more with bacteria to deal .
it 's also considerably easier if you it in <unk> how we there are doing , you just take the nucleus out and there is a different kind , and this is exactly what they all over the clone 've heard .
in <unk> is that chromosome into the cells integrated , but recently , we showed that you have a complete transplant a pair chromosome from one cell to another that can make , and things activate it .
we have cleaned that chromosome one <unk> . speaking , i said , these two as far from how people , mice . we gave some <unk> to make us that chromosome , which could . we <unk> it with what enzymes are about all these proteins to destroy , and it was very amazing when we did it in a cell , gave me -- and they will our very <unk> graphics and here we estimate --
this new synthetic chromosome out in the cell .
indeed we thought that 's the end is , but we tried to the process of something going to bring .
this is the <unk> the evolution , here .
we find all kinds of species here are a second chromosome from have or a third of <unk> , every time of these characteristics , just a second to a species <unk> .
people so that the evolution , imagine a gene that to a moment changed will have a lot of the biology is missing .
there are enzymes are <unk> be called the fact , dna and digest .
that chromosome out that in the cell was has neither of all the chromosomes are we put them have already .
it was in the cell <unk> and i realized that other synthetic chromosome , when someone material <unk> it and so we had an end just a cell with a new synthetic chromosome .
it <unk> the blue , because of the genes are we added up .
and after a very short time i did it all the characteristics of species over and <unk> completely self-folds into a new species , based on the new software that we in the cell ; we have .
all these proteins and changed the membranes and changed now -- when we the genetic code to read , it was exactly what we joined them .
it may be like the genomic <unk> sound , but we can , by we are <unk> here , things quite dramatic change .
so i 've argues that this is not the <unk> is -- this is based on 3.5 billion years of evolution
and i argues that we possibly really think we 're a new form of the cambrian explosion to create in it 's massive new <unk> based on the digital media design might be .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty obvious in terms of what we need .
we 're starting from six to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
about it into my relationship to ask : i was in 1946 , born .
today are three people on planet for any of the back in 1946 , it does ; within a 40 years will it down to be .
we have problems with food , with all-natural fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for half billion people .
it 's a challenge that for any offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion barrels of oil . that are a hundred million barrels a day .
if we think that the biological processes to think , or any process to bring that replace , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , there 's all this co2 from this material that in the atmosphere , goes .
we have now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database , with about 20 million of genes , and i 'd like this belief that the <unk> the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and they look at the variation in the came out .
we hit here in the number of the frontiers in biological reality and at that we can imagine .
we have today leverage technologies , because of those rapid <unk> , in order to do that what we <unk> genetics .
we have now the ability to a big training robots to build the millions of chromosomes , the day can .
if you imagine at those 20 million of the various genes to make or these redundant processes to optimize the octane make or drugs new vaccines , we can do with a just small team over a molecular biology to change as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we can go <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is a shot of cartoon <unk> , we 're working on the you can actually sit down and new species of the design <unk>
you know , we do n't exactly how it will look . we know exactly how their genetic code will look .
we focus on here on fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently , corn and making ethanol or what 's just a bad tv experiment .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation of relatively soon drowned out if they are much higher <unk> have to be like octane fuel or different kinds of <unk> .
but , how we think , the only way that biology is a big impact , no further by the cost of food or the disappointment of care about availability of being is , if we added co2 as starting material can see , and so we 're working on cells are in that go ,
and we think that we the first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that in about 18 months .
the sunlight and co2 emissions are a method --
-- but in our discovery of the world , we all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism that we 1996 , described everyday people .
he lives in the deep , about <unk> miles deep , at virtually <unk> <unk> .
it converts co2 in the methane to under the use of hydrogen from the energy .

within a short four-year time we think , we could the capacity to be one of basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we really -- <unk> goals to actually all across the petrochemical industry . exactly when you do n't that at ted i could do , where else ? a <unk> the energy to be .
but as we 're currently working very , the same market for the development of vaccines to use .
they have it this year with the flu in that we 're always a year , back off and have a dollar to little bit , if it to the right lasts all about .
i think that changed to be able to you <unk> vaccines , in advance this set .
that 's what the future , possibly could look to change , can now the <unk> it also be with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and maybe some <unk> .
we are light years away from people to improve . our goal is it just to be a chance to have long enough to survive to that potentially to do . thank you .
on the last ted conference , i put an introduction to the lhc .
and i agreed back to come to give you to explain how the machine works .
it 's so here . and for all those who did n't there were , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment , which you ever dealt constructively with was -- 27 kilometers in diameter .
his job is it , the conditions to create , which fewer than a <unk> second , after dawn of the universe already existed -- and this up to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just being a ambitious .
this is the machine , beneath the hole in geneva .
we 're taking pictures of <unk> in the detectors on .
at that i work . he calls out an atlas detector , a 44 , up in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here 's a spectacular picture of reference atlas off in the construction , so you the scale up .
at 10 . september the last year went off the machine , i first tedtalk .
and this picture was of an atlas taken .
it was making huge <unk> in control room .
it 's a picture of the first <unk> which are all the way around the lhc <unk> , then you were with part of the lhc <unk> , a set off of particles in the detector <unk> to make .
in other words , when we took this at 10 . september they saw , we knew that the machine works , what a huge victory .
i don’t know , whether this the biggest <unk> generated , or this , when someone the google being visited , and the front page as i found .
it means that we have a cultural difference that next to the science publication ever .
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine thinking up with these <unk> here to do was -- this golden wires , here .
those wires , guiding <unk> <unk> if the machine on <unk> process .
now , the engineers , here will be you look and say , `` no , that do n't . that are small wires . ''
you can this is capable , because if you very far cooling , you 're going to call <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , so , cooler than the space between the stars , you can deliver those wires of my goodness .
in the connections that 's about <unk> magnets used in the lhc , there was a <unk> .
it would have heating up the wires are and <unk> <unk> met and suddenly <unk> resistance .
this was the outcome .
now , all this is another wonderful when you imagine , that the magnets used over 20 tons weigh up and about . 30 inches of shifting .
we bang , so about 50 the magnet
and they had to remove , what we also did .
we <unk> them , <unk> you .
they 're now all back on its way back .
by the end march , is the lhc , again <unk> be .
we 're going to him turn up , and expecting the first data in june , or football world will be , and put our journey on to figure out what the building blocks of the universe .
now , of course , and sort of stir some of these accidents , again , the debate about the value of science and <unk> on such boundary . it 's easy to do something that it down .
i think the fact that it 's how hard is , the fact that about our planetary boundaries of them , is perceived value of the things like the lhc .
i 'm going to my final element words , an english scientist , leaving , humphrey <unk> , the way that i suspect , when he of useless to run his <unk> ruling , his student was michael <unk> , what , `` nothing is such dangerous for the evolution of human mind , when i assume that our scientific , everything forever , are , that 's no mysteries in nature is that our triumphs <unk> are , and that 's no new worlds to presume that there . ''
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
how to write is my profession , but it 's natural more than that .
it 's also my big , for life , love and fascination .
and i do n't expect , that you can ever change .
but it 's recent something weird in my life and my career has been done that gave me to it has brought to my terms of labor used up to rethink .
that dip incident was that , i recently wrote a book -- did a biography of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- that , they were different than all my previous books from some reason in the world beyond and a big <unk> , international <unk> was .
the result is that i , matter where i come , they 'll just as if i the positions of <unk> .
seriously -- the positions of <unk> !
for example , they come up very concerned , up to me and say , if you 're not that they do this success never chased by going ?
they 're not afraid that they all their lives <unk> and again , a book by man , that anybody in the world 's very much ? never again ? ''
okay , that 's really the courage .
it would be worse , when i do n't remember that would that i was about 20 years , when i was a teenager i first of them told that i became a writer , wanted to be , with the same kind of <unk> always been faced with bin .
the people said , were you 're not afraid , never succeed , to have ?
you 've not afraid that you the humiliation of rejection killing ?
you 've not afraid that you this was exposed to your life for <unk> and it 's not something together and that you on a <unk> <unk> dreams are going to -- your mouth is filled with the bitter dregs of ash of failure . ? ''
they 're like , you know .
the answer -- the short answer on all these questions is : <unk>
yes , i 'm afraid , all this thing .
and that i had gone forever .
and i 've got a lot more things that fear that nobody <unk> would .
the algae -- and other <unk> things .
but if it is writing ; i think we have been about it and ask me , why ?
it 's wife ?
it 's logical that by someone would be that it are afraid that has to the work to do to the he was their jobs , you feel ?
and what about the creative enterprises , you for us into uncertainty about the interconnectedness apparition in business -- in a way that 's other professions have n't do ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i can see me in any situation in his dream 40 years as a chemist , remember , he was asked , if he feared would , chemist to be .
with your <unk> , john -- how about telling you ?
i got it does n't come back , you know ?
but about fair to be -- the group of the chemist who have over the centuries , not the reputation of <unk> <unk> people get .
we who seem , but this kind of a range of law . but not just the writer , but the process of genres of it looks like this call to have mental , what 's unstable .
everything that 's to do , is , at the bitter <unk> of really great minds in itself from the 20th century . watch , the young and a lot of my own hand , died .
and even the ones who do n't actually <unk> <unk> , the tracks of their talent , really being neglected .
norman <unk> said , just before he died in his last job interview , <unk> my books have to me a little more <unk>
an extraordinary point that you about your life can do .
but we shrug our n't even , if we do something like to tell you hear , because we do this kind of doctrinal statements for so long as well . somehow we have the notion that level and offers to accept that creativity and suffering from the kind of course <unk> and that art -- the end -- i used to <unk> goes .
the question that i 'm doing here are just want is : is this idea for you 're in all right ?
they feel that ? because with only one inch by looking back -- i feel with this notion not comfortable .
i think they really .
and i think they 're dangerous . and i do n't want to watch , as you go on the next century , taken .
i think it 's better , if we are huge dearth encourage to live .
and i know definitely , that it for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to be able to start , this dark straight in the presumption , which <unk> -- especially in fact , where i fell in my career at particularly am .
that means -- you see , i 'm pretty well . i 'm only about . 40 years old .
i 've probably another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely likely that everything , what i from now on writing about the world as the work score is that after the <unk> success of my last book came , right ?
i say it comes straight , because we 're here , yes , all now , some friends -- it 's most likely that my biggest success behind me is .
oh , jesus , which is a thought !
that are sort of the idea that someone get them to 9 morning to begin to <unk> to drink . and that i want to do n't .
i would prefer to continue this work to do that i love .
so it 's the question : how ?
after some time of <unk> seem to me , and i want to continue to write to be able to a kind of <unk> psychological construct the design must .
somehow i have now find a way , they write a safe distance to right between me and my very natural <unk> of how the reaction to this very well-written will be .
as i 'm in the last year after study models for looking to have to get to do this , i also in the past that said , and i tried to other societies have to find , to see if you might better or <unk> ideas about it did when we , how creativity can help , with the emotional risks to deal of dealing with the creativity are connected .
this quest just took me into the ancient greece and the ancient rome .
please join you me , because the bubble is going up close .
but in ancient greece and rome have the people do n't believe that creativity of people coming , okay ?
they believed that creativity of <unk> <unk> was , from a distant , and unknown source of the most people coming -- from <unk> , and unknown things .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from socrates stated that is known that it 's what i thought , he had one <unk> , and wisdom from on the country will .
the roman had the same idea , which means that kind of <unk> creative spirit of a <unk> .
this is great . the roman did n't really , that 's a genius , a very clever individual site .
they believed that 's a genius this magical <unk> beings who was that i 'd been to think it literally in the walls of a <unk> lives -- like <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artists in the work that kind of the invisible <unk> and the outcome from our design would .
that 's brilliant -- there is it , there 's the distance , of the i talked about -- the psychological construct of you look at the following your work to protect .
and everybody knew that 's how it worked , right ?
the artist of <unk> was certain things are protected , like , for example , too much <unk> , right ?
if your work , brilliant was <unk> you 're not all look for you facilities . everybody knew that you this <unk> genius did , that you helped .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely , your fault , right ?
everybody knew , your moral genius was something <unk> .
so we have people in the west , really long time about creativity to myself .
and then the renaissance and all changed . we had this great idea . and this great idea was , let 's the individual into the center of the universe itself -- about all the gods and mysteries . and there 's no room over the unicorn , warmth-requiring creatures , the commands by the divine core ideas .
it 's the beginning of rational idea of humanism , and people started to believe that creativity has completely from their own individual coming .
first time in the story , to hear people that , or some of artists , a genius call -- instead of that it 's a genius .
i must tell you , i think that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think of a sensation merely a person to allow that he thinks , he or she was like that some point in the pelvis and the essence , and the source of all of divinity , creative , with unknown , an infinite mystery is a little too much responsibility to move them a <unk> , human psyche , even more .
it 's how someone to ask , the sun to swallow .
this is tainted , and distorted picture of your ego and it generates all these <unk> expectations of the success .
i think that the <unk> our artists from the last 500 years of shred the subject .
and , if this is true , -- and i think it 's true -- is the question .
we can it to change ?
maybe one of what we’ve understanding about the relationship between humans and the mystery of creative and return .
maybe not .
if we can that <unk> from 500 years , rational idea of humanism , not just in a <unk> talk to eradicate poverty .
and there 's certainly affecting people in this audience , the very fair science to register to be about the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , etc . work .
i 'll probably not all of them on this journey can take away .
but the question that i do a question wants is : why not ?
why not so think about this ?
because it 's just as much sense like everything else that i 've heard , if it was never about that 's absolutely crazy <unk> <unk> of creative process to understand .
a process of itself -- like everybody knows , it ever has been trying to something to do -- so in other words , actually anyone here -- not always make it behave .
in fact that he can be sometimes it <unk> feel .
i had recently that sort of what did when i the extraordinary american beat poet , <unk> stone , i met , the well over 90 is that , but your entire life poet . she told me that you when the <unk> virginia up out on the fields work . she said , they would feel and can hear like a bit about the landscape on you <unk> .
she said it would like a <unk> move from the air ,
the about this country on you <unk> would .
they felt , when i got it , because it would the planet among their feet to <unk> us .
they knew that you in such a moment , only one could do . and this was -- in her words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran out how the devil population for the house while you about this poem , who 've been . it was only about them to be fast enough to a piece of paper and a pen to get to , so you it , if it through them <unk> to capture , and the blank document up .
in another painting was n't you fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they reached the house , not and that i tried to roll through them and you missed it . she said it would pass tipping over country are , and -- how they said -- <unk> a poet <unk> .
and then there were these moments -- the part i 'll never forget -- they said , that there were moments , there where they almost there was missed .
so , she runs to the house and looking for the paper and this poem goes through them and she reaches a pen , right when it through them <unk> and then -- she said -- it was so when it was going to the other hand , after that makes them and it to put the wars .
you five miles poem is at a tail and moved it back in your body and it 's took on this piece of paper .
in these opportunities that came the poem , equitably and intact , on paper on -- but in reverse tithers -- from last word for the first .
when i that when i thought , `` it 's creepy , it 's exactly how to my creative process <unk>
this is not like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel .
i 'm a <unk> . to work to be able to me every day , the same time to get up and sweats , i was earning and pretty awkward <unk> .
but even i in my <unk> 've sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess that many of you that 's also have done .
even i had to work or ideas , the from a source from me <unk> that i do n't identify you can .
what is a thing ?
and how to join us with a relationship with no about our minds to lose , but for us in the opposite , even in an intellectual things to hold ?
for me that 's the best living example , how this could do the musician and tom <unk> . i had him a few years ago for a journal of the interview .
we spoke with about the issue . and you know what ? the for most of his life was tom the embodiment of <unk> modern artist , trying to these <unk> creative pulses of the in him who were , to control and what about getting .
but then it became more , and quiet . he told me that he 's one day on a <unk> in los angeles start off . and there , everything changed for him .
he went with high speed as he had a patch of a melody , you hear that , how it in my inspirations are often is , for him <unk> hard it 's . and he wants to have them . she is gorgeous . he <unk> , but he can do n't believe .
he has no paper , he has n't a pen , it has n't <unk> .
it 's so , those old <unk> in him up , like , `` i 'm going to this thing to lose and i go out of this song on forever , are going .
i 'm not enough , i can do it ''
but rather than in to panic point , he heard just on .
he ended up all the empathize , and doing something completely new .
he looked out in the sky and said , <unk> , you ca n't see that i actually drive ? ''
<unk> i like when i could just a song goes down ?
if you really exist want to come to a <unk> moment , again , if i told me for you care can .
if now , <unk> today , somebody else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>
his whole <unk> does that they changed .
not the work itself . who was also often that dark matter how they said , and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> that he surrounds it was salvaged when he 's genius from out it took , where he 's nothing more trouble , which came to and then betrayal , where he basically came from . he realized that 's not a skilled behavior , <unk> thing to be had .
it was a component , some miraculous , bizarre , not going to build a kind of conversation 's tom , and the <unk> , <unk> thing that i do n't quite tom was .
when i this story 've heard here she 's also a bit of the way that i worked and it got me already used to be saved .
this idea that saved me when i out in <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> was . i fell in one of dug of doubt in the we all fail , if we look at something to work and it does n't work . you 've started to think that 's a disaster . this is the worst possible book , that ever was written .
not just bad , but of the worst ever .
i started to think , i did this project , just <unk> .
but then i remembered them , like tom in the free the sky was talking and i tried it .
i took so my view from the manuscript , and talked my blog commentary , towards an empty the corner of the room .
i spoke out loud , `` stop them , you thing you and i know each instance , if this book , not brilliant , this is that 's not entirely off my fault , is , right ?
because you see , yes , that i do everything , what i have to <unk> . i have no longer than that .
if you do it 's better have to , you got here show up and your stake in the deal , all .
okay . but , if you that do n't do -- you know what , then the hell that .
i went forward , because it 's my job .
and i want to ask protocol , give that i 'm wondering for my bit of jobs here , scraping
because -- the end it 's how to follow . centuries ago and they have in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> with the sacred and music and music , tomorrow , the hours -- ran into parenting -- to <unk> .
this fixed prices were getting amazing , because the dancer who were highly professional and they were fantastic .
but , and go back , very rare , when it 's something . one of the performers were actually <unk> .
and i know that you know , what i mean , because i know , that they all in your life has been used to do such a performance , have seen .
it was when i would the time <unk> and the dancer walks through a kind thus , you . he did n't help but when he 's ever did -- spends 1,000 nights earlier . but everything on themselves .
and then suddenly appeared he 's no longer in human .
he was the inside up and the bottom up and everything is lit up through a <unk> fire .
as something like the time . now , you know , people what this was . they called it at his name .
they put the hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , <unk>
this is god , you know ?
interesting history 's footnote : when the <unk> <unk> cetaceans moved from them that i need to . are absolutely fearful , over the centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that you still in <unk> and <unk> hear .
if a performer , in spain , something <unk> , something magic did , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> amazing , because it is : a glimpse at god .
and that 's amazing , because we need that .
but , the tricky part of the following the next morning , if the dancer who wakes up and recognizes that 's 11 o'clock at a tuesday , is -- and he 's no longer a <unk> of god , they 're wearing .
he 's just an aging mortal with <unk> knees . and maybe he 'll never again to these heights , rising up .
and perhaps will never again , who will god 's name out , when he reveals itself spinning . but what it 's going to the rest of his life begin ?
that 's hard .
this is a the <unk> done some of a creative life .
but maybe it does not quite as full of the anguish , to be when you in the first not believed they have that the most extraordinary things about her infant mortality of you could move .
if you may not only believe that you a loaner are -- by a poised source for a <unk> time your life , the at somebody else being passed , if you 've done it .
if we start , like to think that changes everything .
so what i began to think , and so i think about the past few months , while i do on the book working , that soon find out , going -- as the dangerous to appetite to be expected <unk> my <unk> success .
what i constantly trying to tell you have , when i think i 'm going to is : did n't afraid .
i was n't feeling disheartened .
just do your job .
i say to continue for your contribution here , whatever he may .
if your job that dance is , dancing .
if that would be dumb divine genius , that you the side of which is to decide , for a moment , a yet touched by miracles through your effort to show , then <unk> ! ''
and if now , i 'm dancing and it may make , dance .
and <unk> ! '' for you -- despite all .
i believe , and i feel that , we should be the teachings .
<unk> ! '' for you -- despite all , just that you the mere human universal love and the <unk> , you 've given that there .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i have these slides just showed up to illustrate that the arctic <unk> to the close to three million years of the size of the bottom of 48 states had to 40 percent down .
but this and there 's not enough to the seriousness , this particular problem of , there 's not the thickness of ice data .
in a sense , is the arctic <unk> that beating heart of our global <unk> .
she grows in winter and contracting for the summer .
the next slide that i 'll show , is a <unk> what in the last 25 years happened .
this <unk> is the red or branded .
so you see , it 's on the blue , drag . this is the year by ice in the wintertime ; it , and contracting for the summer .
we called the <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which the body 's <unk> .
in 25 years will it from here for here 's gone .
this is a problem , because the rise in the frozen reason for the arctic sea <unk> , where it very large amounts of <unk> carbon , there , which , when he <unk> , of microbes and methane , which is .
comparing with the total amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , be about this amount of double , if we have this critical point out .
already today <unk> in some of shallow lakes in alaska , methane from themselves from the water .
professor <unk> walter university in alaska 's associated with another task to another one shallow seas in the last winter , across .
wow !
she 's good . the question is , how it gets us was subjected to .
and one reason is , this massive heat up with the greenland from the north .
this is a year <unk> .
but the volume , are significantly greater than ever .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know how the sea through <unk> up here flows into them into the ocean .
those rivers so let 's rapidly to .
other end of the planet , the antarctic , the biggest use the ice on planet .
last month volunteered , researchers that the entire continent now a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> , the about a couple <unk> up is , is particularly powerful in the melting .
this is 20 feet above sea level , like to greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> the ice , you see up some lakes , the front of a few years of glaciers were .
forty percent of people in the world get the half of their <unk> from that are draining down .
in the andes , is this glacier , the <unk> for this town .
the <unk> they <unk> .
but if you <unk> , will also that most of water <unk> .
in california was a 40 percent reduction in <unk> the sierra seen .
this case of the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you read them , are seriously .
this <unk> in the whole world that leads to a dramatic improvement on fire .
and the disaster areas around the world i have a really <unk> and before unprecedented degree gained .
times as many in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you this in history associated with a look , you can see , what it <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced , all of 24 hours -- 25 million tons per day in the oceans .
you look at the area of the eastern pacific , right . look at the american across west , and both of indian <unk> , where it 's a drastically decline of oxygen in the sea , there .
the largest single factor for the global warming , next to logging , which is 20 percent , which is this burning of fossil fuels .
it 's a problem , and coal is that 's nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are one of those two largest <unk> , together with china .
and the suggestion was , many more <unk> to build .
but we start to a shift to see .
here are the , the last few years painted by , with some green are alternatives , the world were .
<unk> there 's a political contest in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent to clean coal to promote , which is , already a contradiction in itself is .
this reminded me at something .
for christmas this off , with me to home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> out .
they have it <unk> in the news .
this is in our country , the <unk> can promote america .
this happened to christmas .
one of the ads , the <unk> for christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy inside .
it , there in the shell and wealth in america , and he helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> going to every day , clean .
he is affordable , and <unk> , and maintenance workers will remain in wages , and this bread .
this is the source of coal in west virginia .
the most <unk> is the director of massey coal .
they let me a very clear to say , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry 's comic , they do n't know , what they talk .
so it has the alliance for <unk> other campaigns to get involved in '' .
this is one , a part of her .
the <unk> we see the climate change , as a serious problem for our business .
so we have it us to the top <unk> set of a significant <unk> spend about a <unk> on the way to bring to the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is not much .
we think , she 's clean -- and it smells , but good .
so , do you can do n't worry about the climate .
let you take this us .
<unk> coal , you have a lot about this .
so let 's see a tour of modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet this burning of coal , one of the main reasons for the global warming is , the coolest in clean <unk> that you see here , changes everything .
you take it , just on , this is the world today , clean <unk> .
finally he blends into the positive alternative to our economic challenge and our challenge the national security .
america 's a climate crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the major thread of these all together , is our dependence of <unk> <unk> the dirty and coal and <unk> oil .
but now there 's a courageous , new solutions to us from this <unk> able to be free .
<unk> america to 100 percent cleaner , electricity , again , within the next 10 years .
a plan to go back to work to bring to us safer place to do and to help the global warming continues to stop .
finally , a solution that 's large enough , our to solve problems .
<unk> america in new . they get more out .
this is the last .
it 's about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest way , our dependence of the old , and diapers <unk> , the world is focused , to reduce malpractice .
the future is here . wind , the sun and a new energy system .
and also investing in the right from well-paid jobs to create .
<unk> america in new . it 's time , reality to accept .
there 's an old african proverb that : `` if you to be fast you want to go alone .
if you will come you want to go together . ''
we have far come , which is rapidly .
thank you .
so i 'd begin to ask them , at the time your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> played .
while they realized , how to the hands are rising and <unk> , the <unk> pick up and moves , we learned when they actually , to think about , and problems through the understanding and change the spatial context of solving .
the spatial can think is closely with linked , how we a lot of our environment .
as a scientist -- inspired by the kind of our minds interacting with a physical objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , i began to wonder : what would be , if we use computers would that instead of a <unk> to the like a digital <unk> on one of this was tie these moves -- what if some of us with both hands were could and data , physically and take and they kind of accessing could , how we really want ?
this question was that 's emotional , that we used for probing the answer to credit and <unk> developed .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of a <unk> .
you can start with the hand , being moved , they 're not perceive , you can all its motion capture and they have a screen and a <unk> .
more importantly , they 're physically , why you like lego blocks are merely by the stick out of hands and one can move .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools <unk> be and a consciousness for their movements really going to each other beings and the intricacies of our <unk> with you see , then we up with the study of new and <unk> <unk> start .
i 'll start with some simple example .
this <unk> is the <unk> <unk> and if i asked him in a direction <unk> , is the video just played back ; if i asked him in the other way <unk> to get to do it backwards .
and this interactive portraits pick up being true .
if i so they were going to traffic lights that their interest .
if you <unk> are surrounded , you 'll notice that , and make a little nervous .
and they feel as their movements and the opposite .
an interesting number of the consequence of us to see it started , was that we are everyday gestures on the data can use could , like the colors , like to them into , how this with <unk> does .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can use them to paint in the in the center to pour , where they then mixed use .
if we do it carried , we can be a little <unk> .

i 'm here -- that 's a fibonacci numbers that i do with a simple <unk> programs .
this is a game with words , this kind of a mixture of <unk> and <unk> is .
basically , getting each round up every <unk> by <unk> letters and while you 're trying to modify words to form , are these about a dictionary pass .
then , after about 30 seconds , is back up and you have a new <unk> and new ways to try .
thank you .
that are some kids who were on a trip to the media lab , came out . i could you get , it 's space and i have a video of recorded .
they have it really loved .
an interesting fact that looked at this kind of applications is that you the people not a lot of instructions , there must be .
everything else you tell you have is `` you make those words , '' and you know exactly what to do .
here are still a few people that 's test .
this is our youngest <unk> there , the bottom right .
it turns out that he 's the <unk> just a pile them wanted .
so for him , they were just blocks .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we want a powerful for <unk> develop .
this is <unk> .
he can see new characters in the scene of them , by making the <unk> the picture pick , this figure shows .
here 's let 's the sun <unk> .
the sun goes on
now , then he 's a <unk> in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good job ! yeah .
by making the <unk> shake and they were put it could , the characters -- let me ...
-- his own story , innovate .
hello !
it 's a story with open up and he can decide , how they developed .
flying his cat .
the last example , for that today , i 've developed , it to show , is a <unk> for <unk> , that we recently have evolved and in the <unk> as a sound , how <unk> , singing and the drums , presumably acting .
each has four different variations ; you can choose , which you wants to use .
and you can these sounds in the sequence , keep that you turn into any more complex patterns can .
and you <unk> you a , by you just a <unk> at a <unk> holding .
there are the effects that you live , we can change , like . hall and filter .
you connect him with a particular sound , and one from him go to hire .
and then the overarching effects of the speed and the loudness of you on the entire sequence , well .
so let me .
we start , where we are <unk> in two <unk> keep putting together and in a variety of accessing , you expand and a little bit more the voice is also .
now i 'm i 'm a bass , adding positives .
i 'm going there were drums , to do .
and now i connect to the filter the drums , so i the effect of live in can .
i can the entire sequence to speed , by i do it went into the one or another way <unk> .
and now i connect to the filter , even with the bass ; at a little longer term .
i can the sequence , while they 're going to change .
so i have to do n't the reservations are planning , but i could use improvisation ; they are actually increase the right up .
and finally , i can the entire sequence <unk> , by i the <unk> go left tend to .
thank you .
so as you can see , because my excitement of course , new <unk> to develop , the better to the best fit , how our brains and bodies operate .
and today , i had time , you a bunch of the new <unk> and some of ways to attend to show , what we in our lab to work .
the idea , the i 'm going to the journey , want , is that we on the cusp of these new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media are , the information in our world for part of our needs to nation .
thank you ,
i 'm on the talks with you all .
