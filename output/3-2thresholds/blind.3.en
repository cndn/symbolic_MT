yes , good day mean , ladies , my gentlemen .
very much indeed , thanks for the references here today , to talk .
and i have to me , yes , now , myself , imagine .
my name is christian <unk> and i 'm going to some weird that term , <unk> it at the city of food .
that are called , <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one personnel to talk is an organization , and thirdly , the public policy .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city in charge .
and yes , so you make , it’s not very popular .
i know .
and beyond , and that 's something which my son , particularly like about , i am also <unk> .
that means that i 'm the head of the <unk> firemen .
<unk> <unk> and a kilometer <unk> .
and as i have i told me , i thought , is obviously a subject matter , based on i do you today <unk> want .
that most engaging with the topic <unk> , because this is also heard to the firemen .

you know him .
he was once before in general <unk> .
and then i start something not very much as serious to say .
i <unk> you a able to .
so we talk , if it , so to a risk , there , that we have a moment ago , a catastrophic stand , for example <unk> <unk> , the rush .
many people are the way .
it 's pushing , it turns it <unk> to go .

nobody seems to lead to belong .
the suitcase heard about any .
suddenly an <unk> .
leave you that <unk> .
the police comes to fire department , <unk> .
people are calling .
these ones <unk> .
, get out .
what 's because we go ? to ask <unk> .
we know this also not or we allowed to it does n't say .
the people leave the building .
children , crying .
some of falling , and perhaps , because it all very quickly go to worry .
suddenly a <unk> .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic , breaks out .
i am now here on .
the rest of bastards i your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy , that i <unk> 've gone . <unk> ?
this is this ago in this week is happening in <unk> .
there 's a such a suitcase , who are remained .
afterwards , and asked , totally out that only , in <unk> , nine thousand pounds of drugs at what they were .
but the people were so just , and so has a friend told me that tells , out of the building , forced into .
it was nothing i said .
and it came that same kind <unk> suddenly , at least in the group on a , my friend in the my friend , they 've found myself .
god , be thank you is n't panic , which have , otherwise would be looked at the long ago , not so safe to run out how it seems .
you see , in a descriptions , in a <unk> disaster is to communicate , a very important thing well .
communication is why there 's important , because the people in this situation is literally for wireless communications <unk> .
they want to know what 's because we go .
it used in the good , old was time that for the authorities , still pretty simple .
we just have nothing i said , or we 've got lied .
why ?
because the area called the <unk> was for .
you which , so that made by the to say , god , the people of early in panic , because we say you would n't the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a time the social media , in a time of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public <unk> , in a time of she used and public television is not more possible .
which simply and it 's emotional , therefore , because it 's one is not be moral is , and secondly , mostly are anyway , we the past when agency , the talk about the event to report .
you remember wondering , may still hold of the accidents , in the hudson river , ago , is that is , some year , already ago .
the first where they are about it came at twitter .
of someone , the on a ferry was and just make and it 's emotional immediately <unk> , here 's a plane <unk> and we save the people now .
that was no <unk> .
you see that we 're dependent on , today , which simply and it 's emotional of the first place , the truth to say , and very <unk> to inform .
because , mostly are we obviously also the past , the supposedly , the truth will know , because we as agency to kind of course it goes to pay attention , that we just <unk> information to pass .
it is that are public media , or as well , private media , either not so very in touch or they do it yet also not .
of therefore , we will be in the food , and that 's also something that already , even by the media has gone are , we can be careful about how we in the future with <unk> deal .
and to do we will be the good old puppet , again , engaging .
however , just as a form of the <unk> .
that means that we 're going to the next few years about a hundred puppet , in the the <unk> build , the , some of you know that still , <unk> , if it 's room , to <unk> coming .
it used it was so that .
you may be you know , still , what 's three in short , once in short , once a long and once in short , which means .
i know it 's not anymore .
we 're going to the right now is linking up with all <unk> , that we this point , in , have , so <unk> , about facebook , over onto twitter , over the radio <unk> also at night , over the tv and at all over the internet and the local media and so forth and immediately , connected course , still with <unk> to pick up getting the information on going to get .
and we know , we need to there 's very quickly and <unk> operate and we need to there 's very quickly and <unk> inform , because the zones , and citizens to be otherwise frightened .
and us , ultimately , also not anymore , that to believe what we tell you want .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster is so one hand , a question of strength , about all media , that we can be available to stand , and it 's also a question of the credibility .
credibility that 's our biggest problem , because the zones , and citizens to say , either , oh , the proportion time again , true all not , or they say , the <unk> us , it 's all much worse than it in reality is .
we have therefore , too good about what 's done with facebook and twitter , still ago , recently .
also that you may have some of in them the media has taken off .
we have a longer <unk> in the food <unk> suppose .
and it 's this one thing called the chemical bomb .

the only problem is , many of these bombs 've never works and you 're only after as long ago in <unk> under the other things in the food <unk> .
and there , we were from one elderly gentleman , the be some extent , how he so beautiful in the the protocol , i said , <unk> wanted , we have been now , he had seen as you <unk> <unk> by it 's and now <unk> did he the authorities as to be informed , that there was a bomb , it is . laughter throughout the background .
the way since i have to acquire multiple older and gentlemen , reported in the whole <unk> .
we 'll see , what we still do anything to find .
these smart bombs to get off immediately shifts of place , not <unk> be , but <unk> be .
and so then we have in <unk> park , which simply and it 's emotional one , in every sense of making the word , a bomb , gloomy , let me .
and <unk> in history of the city , the whole communicate about facebook and twitter , going to let me with the consequence , that the entire <unk> far over <unk> <unk> collectively , followed this is .
and the media were thrilled . laughter throughout the background .
we had n't even with are telephony , but the have <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .
the whole had a great the effect for us , because the credibility that will <unk> increased about these social media .
just therefore , they have to me also a sign of giving , when i stop me to do .
i can go from this is not the day of o'clock at mit .
this is the credibility that as well , because the first of these social media , the advantage to have to keep them very much information to pass .
not so very <unk> are , because the members that there are continuing , or the <unk> of how to calls them , a high <unk> have .
secondly , fast corrections .
if anything not true to write that again , someone who immediately , so that the credibility , of the i just talked , to have , clearly going up , because just looked at the entire community that in principle , among the reports are involved in this is .
and it 's a very high <unk> therefore , so if anything that 's wrong , then it can also very quickly <unk> be .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> , the that 's exciting found , as a bomb , in <unk> park , up goes .
of therefore we 've come from all the things that you in recent years happened are , and it are much more <unk> happens as intense encounter a still going to think , as intense encounter a third .
also the city of food can every day of such a catastrophic home and look for the whole .
a bomb , the in <unk> to cure in a park , is certainly not that sort of .
but they can also , and also , after <unk> we 're now , in <unk> be found , and then i am , we there with our <unk> and try to the in seven meters deep <unk> .
and if the , you think to people in munich , you think , among other cities , if the then <unk> to cure , because they men 's called a <unk> has , the you have conventional not to defuse that can , then we know already , to be a variety of houses , then we do n't even more so look like before .
and that to communicate it 's important , one hand , because it 's room in a in a world <unk> <unk> velocity is necessary , communication to run to pick one you also be freaked out to prevent the space to give to worry about to wear enough of the people 's informed 're going to stand for why worry about to wear enough of the people in the are able to now , there are these difficult situation hire .
and the social media to help us as well , man , very credible , to be , because ultimately , they all of hit the communications are involved , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> is how we play in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly also still in the <unk> to the big part of had .
of that 's why is today <unk> not just a job of the authorities , not just a job of the firemen , or the <unk> , '' of <unk> , the <unk> , red cross were kind etc. , but about communication in the catastrophe and to tackle a disaster is about us all of pollution .
and <unk> has that showed .
there 's about twitter and over facebook , a majority of the aid has gone , if we also know , and you still , so overwhelmed with was , because suddenly <unk> of people have any <unk> build wanted and you knew what does n't even more , where the <unk> are .
this is also , there 's still a lot to do , indeed , the public communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented solidarity with the <unk> and the the redeveloping has just demonstrated that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication to do n't even more efficient way to think are .
and i hope that i do you a little more convinced of what you have shown that this media , that yes , actually for the beautiful things of life in that often is used to also in <unk> its meaning and dedicated to do it , and that we as a city , the for the flight , <unk> in charge is , this instrument , in the future is also , and then , new , and very different well as be able to her , to the citizens , to use the zones , and citizens and so that the end i now , and <unk> me very welcome for your attention as well , if i do you the entire time , barely seen , to have .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> different .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , as you just have heard .
and i 'm now , they also still have , and , a own <unk> to reasons .
what it is that i do there <unk> produce 'm going to that i 'll ask you also in a few years ago .
before i do that , i have to but a few things <unk> .
the first is , , i believe that we stories that you want to life need .
that we are no stories , not could live .
furthermore , i believe that it is very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories , there , as of the entertainment in fact is able to be .
then i think is still , that the internet , the infinite possibility is roughly , of fact that well as anybody <unk> get really neat <unk> will .
and four , i 'm <unk> convinced of that people are this has been created , to be creative .
and that you happier , are , once you can be creative allowed to .
ever more people are happy , you cut dramatically better understand how it 's the world .
very logical .
these better world is now , however , just a byproduct .
in your first line , i am , how we already said , a storyteller .
and the story that i tell you want to begin to occur at midnight , in a <unk> , in the just happy hour <unk> singing , will .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now get them any of the <unk> and the the singing `` not so much with , because in the moment , in the the it at midnight 's become , something happens with her .
it 's something happens in your mind , in your body , with their perception .
and they has n't really word for .
they do n't know , which there just happened .
i 've all the same word for .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see on the one side <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and everything is pretty white .
i cried . ' feeling that i 'm kind pretty <unk> .
<unk> .
and on the other side , we have the wonderful , then in <unk> oz -- with very very much color .
and that it was this point , in , so first told that i 'd better <unk> and write , when that i draw .
so , the first , what <unk> now with their new perceptions , you see , is a stranger , man with <unk> <unk> hair , the front of her , it says , you very seriously at , and says , very much , congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> educates <unk> about it on to keep them to a very special kind of people heard .
they became defined as <unk> born .
players are people , the ab your <unk> <unk> to pursue their lifetime had to be .
of you who knows <unk> ?
very good .
imagine , you want has , <unk> in it <unk> n't swords , if you go together meeting , but <unk> from the pocket .
so these cube , <unk> , <unk> , anything possible .
what really important is , the players have no insight , on their <unk> .
we know , yes , also not , whenever we die .
i wish is , to participate in a long life , but we know a 's just not .
it can also the morning , all already been over to be .
and to grow up is it at my players , this , which .
you know , do not anything to us how they because actually can play .
that , and again , every lost minute could the last been to be .
a player , the his entire lifetime <unk> has , <unk> in the moment of <unk> like a candle that do <unk> will .
now you can range , of course , ask : if that because so is dangerous , why are playing the then all ?
the answer is very clear : that .
without play , without any players to change a around , <unk> , all of gray , and only when a player 's military , he is actually alive .
that were destined to play born .
so .
this story of <unk> and as you now the world of players <unk> , to acquire their first challenges — turns , little bottle of course , inevitably , in <unk> in love , this is the story that i tell you want .
and that is , in form of a <unk> .
the first season has 12 to follow , sorry for me is here 's a <unk> happens , the i just got to be late seen , to have .
so , twelve follow in the first season with a certain length of each , five to seven minutes .
this type of <unk> , a result , after the other , beautiful <unk> told , that you know about .
that television , do it 's been on his <unk> nothing else .
this is not new .
and if it 's all i would , then if only ' i now one is finished .
and it also do n't actually here .
now let 's hear , but first , right , go .
we go still going to even <unk> back .
what 's the most famous set out of the movie or from the series ?
it can only a give , right .
thanks .
as if we the example , if you could have .
and that 's exactly true on my players , which is not to .
of which can it very very many give them .
there 's so many different games .
it you just have to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so forth and so the job .
and so just <unk> 's also the number of course of the players .
and to grow up also be here , lots of stories that all be told you want .
now would be the next question : who is it ? because all going ?
i cried . ' already a quite high opinion of me .
i hold me for sufficient smart and in such a creative .
but i know that the hundreds of brains more to produce as just one , even when hal 's mine is .
therefore it came directly to the idea that you the crowd , with in the process of pulling in .
what would , if we <unk> 're not just brook or to allow , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you , very very welcome to a , the development of this <unk> with they wanted to .
imagine , you want ago , for instance , in the result , three diving into a <unk> on , the they 're totally class of finding , because he told them , for example , seen her grandfather , reminds us .
furthermore , they 're a giant fan of <unk> .
then you can now just , with the world today , technology is that yes , not far more so hard , a <unk> do .
and this store them on the <unk> up , where it then straight , and this is that really cool <unk> , the the really interested in the audience down this is .
that is , it 's not about anywhere , given , but it lands right into the right there , where it ends up to decide .
that really nice thing is that we the internet , are .
and the internet , you ca : well , really do anything .
so , every medium is kind allows us .
that means you as viewers , you can write , drawing , spin , what do anything that they do want .
and if we were also now again this structure , look .
this looks <unk> bit of <unk> web , right ?
so this <unk> , what common set up going .
and i 'm really <unk> convinced of , that the internet was born to pick exactly that kind of stories to tell .
it just doing , unfortunately , still not so many , or at all -- none .
so , now go , ' i but even still a step further and i 'll leave the audience ourselves to the players to be .
which is in a <unk> .
because you can fly against the characters from the series , who 'd but also against people in the real environment , the plant , and these <unk> on your phone market .
<unk> thing here , that you know of all are also all very very well , are is something like , mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
this wonderful , which will the road , just very rapidly developing .
and on the i do n't go into can , because i do over again , and after two minutes , i 'd need .
we sum up again , together .
everybody 's time you looking up of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> i could this before the judges with the computer , right now , i have to this is about to detect : the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
the have to me the first prize for the best <unk> given .
and i must say to that : these jury really was from the legislators of the bank , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so the common-sense definition of people , should it my .
and when i the to convince you can , here with my : the internet right to use , narrative structures to revolutionize , the way , still better world , then i believe , i can actually every convince them .
so .
everybody 's time has done , why is called the whole , then , so ?
because they had been alone in this names all areas covered be .
we have of course , i 'll find the <unk> : who 's has done , i 'm has done , so you 're has done , everybody 's time on this .
of course , then that die .
in the series of it 's very very much died .
everybody 's time has done it means : everyone needs to time to die .
and then of course , too : everyone 's time has done in the sense of everyone can be part , if it do want .
this is me totally important .
i come ' , from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse i think , after , as if it so a <unk> will .
i do n't know , if you 've seen that .
if you in the theater , are and then it 's the actor , so in the auditorium and all this : oh god , please now , not me .
and this is it just might not .
so it 's volunteer interaction .
and nobody has to .
he can also just this audience must be .
the reason why i german , speaking is the , that the entire project we also on the german , will be , the first place .
that has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> while his way , and i was again and wondered : go the whole river , in english , they 're the bigger , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
notice that i can just say : the german <unk> is the third largest the world .
the <unk> is the english , then it 's the spanish , and then the german .
it 's now , not so , when we would allow us in any kind of little niche move .
and also think i really actually really , if it also other people like that goes like me , that the people will be grateful to be for something that 's not by any <unk> <unk> was , where the end , then everybody <unk> and every pun <unk> been is .
if all this is so what happens is , as i do it like to have said , then goes the first of the result now on the first <unk> <unk> online .
and if you . they can now ask , why i because now i 'm here held in <unk> , where it yet , under the headline <unk> worth , <unk> involved .
notice that i went on also a couple of thought was done .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also pretty much depend on of <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also have , and and <unk> .
and i can actually really just say , that this whole know , incredibly important is , and incredibly <unk> .
but it uses , yes , everything is nothing to having a 's not apply them .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just time , all taken of have , what i like i learned what you have .
and it applied , to have .
and i 've never runs a 's good .
i can actually really just say .
so , if now somebody who thinks : i want to do have already my part contribute , i had degrees ' one idea <unk> character or do . i ' `` ai drawing <unk> cartoon , or what do anything that , that 's also about already now .
you find us already in the internet .
on facebook .
so awesome , as freely in the speaker to talk .
yes , <unk> ' i also .
welcome . to : you can memories are wiping out ?
question , among them :
you can memories are wiping out ?
you might be wondering , because of explaining all remember , what in your life ever 's happened ?
you have still <unk> remember that ?
who has who can be wondering , still hold of all remember that ?
it go to do n't hands up .
so you 're memories are wiping out ?
apparently been touched .
thank you .
no , just like that we want a 's us today is n't do .
and then i would be the talk , probably quite quickly .
again a good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today at night , the i went on by night , because he two of my passions , or my two great passions , right now comes together .

and <unk> certain time , i 'm also now as a coach , and its consultants , in the private and the vocational field of the way .
on the one side and i 've gone so with the with the computer , very much more engaged , on the other side , i 'm currently working on this in the in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how can , because that that this the human beings ?
how do you because that change ?
the to change a comparison with figuring out .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : so whenever we can , when it , whenever we can build a computer , the way it works like the human brain ?
so , and i think i made ' there are we already quite close .
so i think twice ' so two , three hundred years , no longer need that 's not anymore .
but , let me time i carry out , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> bit needs .
so the comparison , between the the computer on the one side and our brains to the other side .
if we the computer taking , then based yes , everything , so your smartphone , her a tablet , her <unk> and also these cameras and all of all these smart refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he called road , cpu , central <unk> <unk> .
these parts are assembled from <unk> transistors .
the word has all are already know each of quality and in <unk> it will always been so as a triangle , the arts .

in our computer in our cpu , we have , i cried . ' extra <unk> ago about five hundred million of small parts .
and the switch , because i managed mess .
we can store , things , we we calculate the things , we had degrees ' one you albert einstein 's say , listen , yes , 'n computer can all you can you can be very much , very quickly , but actually he can just zero and one , compare .
more he ca n't .
he 's actually quite this made me .
we want a 's time you compare with our brain .
our brain has as the smallest unit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have of them , also because i figured <unk> , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our gray matter of land up here in there .
this beautiful but is , our our neurons have not only three fundamental connections , but the have the way to <unk> per neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , i was just because it 's and beautiful , is about 10 trillion .
that are 10 with fourteen zeros <unk> .
so , because you see already the complexity of the brain is struggling to have a little bit higher than that , what we currently are still as a computer security .
we want to the <unk> time trying to say , maybe the a or other people know the head , the first supercomputer to the had their own power station next door to stand , ha , the <unk> , and with the <unk> the <unk> was the campus <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> sometimes it 's , but the box up here it takes about twenty watts .
and the self is , and this is that they ' the equivalent of two great bananas , so more , they need not and her their calculators up there 's pouring in a wonderful .
if we now <unk> a giant good part up here , <unk> a giant good calculator with <unk> , why we 're using the then not , why i remember that we then things ?

and <unk> there 're wrong , it’s the advertising , a bit .
ten percent , yes , perhaps , but our brain is yes , in the course of our evolution , at this mass <unk> , that was yes <unk> smaller , very in the middle of us is still our <unk> with the inside , anything other business , <unk> educated .
this is when you are n't happen , because we do n't that use .
why it seems to try and so that we keep the largest piece of one <unk> let me ?
maybe you are so yes , the notion of <unk> ?
the principles i compared ' '' of always so beautiful with the iceberg , if you the iceberg , see , in in the sea , then is that they ' up so the top , then there 's the <unk> , the bottom of it 's a <unk> .
and these 10 percent up , that are that 's about this , what our sense when , our <unk> mind is , <unk> going , but <unk> percent , and she 's a giant <unk> ab , <unk> .
we <unk> the statement we broke <unk> we broke <unk> we broke <unk> we broke <unk> <unk> slow ♫ but we broke <unk> the creative .
and space to time <unk> on this memory , coming back , maybe you know all the one or other people with <unk> memory .

that goes , but there is a 's very , there 's and a particular , called a <unk> , so someone with <unk> , somebody the most products on a field <unk> , the excellent treatment is , the has a so good <unk> memory , the will was in a plane , just a bunch , in a plane , in a helicopter , so fast is that they ' he then ow ' not , over rome flew , which , rome to view , yes , so rome is yes , now : ow ' n't necessarily the minimum of the city , which , after years ago , a giant sign of the sheet , put it and has started to rome to draw .
and , they do n't somehow , so here , so the river , and there is that they ' that , no , every home , every single door , and every window has he once seen it , he <unk> , he was able to go back to paper into trouble .
and where they 're from now that ?
so why ca the that , why we ca n't that , well , the things will this is we may very close to say that the <unk> bit more access on his <unk> percent of the craft that has .
now we 're using the yes , as well , but why , can i now , not the day of the day of <unk> last night , remember , in the details of ?
'n <unk> <unk> of me has to any interesting about what 's done .
he has even the example , you 've also been working and has with a <unk> worked , that had her experience is completely eliminated , this was n't even more of your mind , that <unk> <unk> by the brain , that 's not happening , that 's gone .
wonderful , so that came the very well sure .
now went and so , but it 's why , the people <unk> to do .
there , it has been in a very safe session , off the end or after this event back now can , even when you , it’s not more active remember this could , she was then the hallmark of the car , we see , in the top of these people <unk> , that was faced not <unk> , that stood fifty meters on .
and actually is with this board marker for one of the state 's caught been .
the second what i very great found , was , he has a lady in <unk> suppose , that has told me , and her mother : you are always going to alice in wonderland and i read it has when they 're small was , so four years .
there was driving them on the which resulted in your mother and her mother has been reading .
and then did he told her short , in a trance , pushing , but the time ago .
then , it has begun to read , she was four times more than that happens is , they could then , still do n't read , today can look at this .
and then you have has said he said , i tell me time the <unk> .
they 've actually a specimen from alice in wonderland found , where that on this side of the text it said , the the lady and i read by .
the brain has so this side of like , she was <unk> , as a picture .
after that could you read .
so yes , we 've actually have access to that , but we seem there in the normal life would say we <unk> way <unk> to have anything to us not to <unk> .

and , it was now <unk> long tonight , put them . they can now , but <unk> comfortably to myself , ha , <unk> bit above and , then you can i ask you , close them , but very simple path , very quickly . your eyes .
and you remember by , a very <unk> , positive that event in the recent past , yeah .
they take the first , what comes .
and , if you that now do , going to you might notice that you to this memory of a visual part of getting .
they get , maybe a picture , maybe as a movie ?
some , falls into the fact , not only on , because we felt that normally do , but that make them to the first time i realized that .
and if you can see that , then it be you to either in the movie revenues are , from their eyes , all experience , or how where , see on a canvas .
this one , we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , they allowed to the final thought back to solve , they have to the eyes , again , open the .
who has , because a visual information to get , time hand up ?
yes , there 's go now , but <unk> ' a few hands up , that 's so , 'n third kind of what i would say , yes , that 's about this , what i expected of have , it 's it 's actually something , what we so often do that it is us in the first moment he ca n't <unk> .
well , make ' <unk> on .
<unk> what we also is beautiful , together , those memories , if you memories <unk> , comes yes , not just that memory , up , <unk> <unk> feeling that says , we <unk> a positive that event and i cried . ' the a or else 's smiling can see , there was so yes , that was beautiful , there were , yes , they laugh , and already is the memory may still there , actually it shows we do with memory fades as well , beautiful or other feelings to leave .
and now here 's what 's very fascinating .
<unk> anything before i was , yes , well , it that our brain power , among the spot no difference between what we actually remember i 've and the the , from what we just imagine , from what we <unk> .
also that they can try out , if , you want to home <unk> sit down , little something in the future to discuss that still not happening is , they 're going to similar information is to be like something , if you by , something to remember , what in the past was .
and , , you know , but there are lots of these stories that you 're wondering , so i told in <unk> round , of that time .

if we that already in stopping to do , so if we really our memories so changing , why we doing this because not take action , i 'll ask them ?
<unk> , when i 'm here , we came , has to me my uncle is a picture i showed , of his hut in switzerland .
a very nice image , it 's also a very beautiful hut .

and why we doing this because not with our own thoughts , our own memories , hey , what it bothers me , who 's because , i guess that still more fun doing , and produce , what i there degrees think ?
they 've actually , make a freedom , in their own thoughts .
<unk> you are so yes , so some people , the that they do you see the morning , if you just like this gray have eyes , which is because we go ?
yes . i 've ' `` bad n't had to me was about the whole <unk> through the head .
really all the night and , this idea of made me not anymore , go .
i think it 's way around the he made the idea to do n't go .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he has been , germany , came , because his mother in <unk> stayed , and he has they just awful missed .
what the father has done , so he which , every night with the son , sat down , and has said , or has been wondering , so , what was because the most beautiful , what 's happening today ?
what was because the most beautiful , use in the time , and then did he him tell let , has led him <unk> let , has led him , just tell let , what today that great 's happened .
and , it within two weeks went and so , the the son is doing great .

and the today is the has that all the youth about being done with the , the today is one of the <unk> people , that i know .
it so these are not the memories , the us to influence , in the side , how we are , but it 's our focus on it , our focus on what kind of thought we use .
and how much energy we 're going to appear to waste , or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , , that was today now : ow , that 's so , <unk> this practice , ' i but i was really not , then they make it 's , but in time , like , you know how might tom cruise in this <unk> fiction , film did he this , these these <unk> computer , where he did the files <unk> <unk> , when they do that now , but also time , looking for them their image , that <unk> have of this , well , not very much like this . one a have to tell you , yes , well , <unk> now <unk> happens , but , <unk> , away with it .
what ham , ' we because <unk> ' still , ah , what 's nice , yes , look over time , there , <unk> , yes , that has to me <unk> ' real fallen , man , that was that was beautiful , well ?
and then they take that , but the time with .
they take that with in their <unk> and let them that go work .
or if you have someone <unk> not following , <unk> , she was it <unk> their your boss , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , laughter , they <unk> .
so , take them here also the image , put them <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let them in the background horses jump , yes , they laugh , why it seems to them ?
because they <unk> imagine , because those individuals concerned with funny this is .
and you can be much better with the situation , suddenly we deal .
ca : man memories so delete it ?
no , i think our brain has been so much greater capacity , that 's all that can be .
and so , power , but nothing , because we can free to vote , how strong , we can to focus and how important , we have a traumatic event , a memory , a thought rate , it comes on us to time .
my plea to continue to you to with them , you play with the images in your mind , they use the power of their an element , and they give him every day <unk> , the their lives in the process .
yes , the good afternoon .
thank you for the references .
if i on a party , asks me , what i was so in my spare time doing , and telling me , and i together with friends , a <unk> <unk> and <unk> , then i have the shining eyes and in the minds of my audience , and the <unk> of the dancing crowds , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> arise .

frank <unk> once said , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and so similar to behave , i knew that 's also older , what we do .
so they yet a glimpse of getting about , i right after speaking , i put them a short film , brought .
a film .

this brings it 's my view , the right place on the point .
since <unk> growing the <unk> from the <unk> feel like it turns out , something completely different one caveat .
we makers , are today , so forth between eighteen , and the middle , the end of two decades old , and have very early in our youth who experienced , which is an incredible force and delight us , classical music <unk> .
we have , but also have experienced , that the <unk> years of the <unk> and the head <unk> us , because some happiness , well , a little <unk> can .
and we 're in this is something belief , that 's called the crisis the classical music , not the side of content , so , among the music event itself , but at their <unk> survival .
so we think about the question , how do we have a <unk> are able to say that the music , the near , the friends and this force over again , there , the so that we so very , seen her like .
how do we have a <unk> organizing , that beyond the <unk> years of the <unk> work ?
we put the parameter that they do , from the classic concert will know , space , time , light , context , basically in the question .
we take the example of the relationship between <unk> and musicians .
normally , there 's between the stage and the <unk> a gap .
we 're trying to the <unk> .
here you a picture of our <unk> .
the musician , sitting in the audience , drink beer , having an alien , in the breaks down with the <unk> , standing on to play a , two pieces , put little , again in the audience .
the whole thing is the course of the evening , a little <unk> .
everybody , the feel like it has <unk> , coming on the stage and goes back .
or that 's sitting in the concert .
in the classic concert , it 's case that you on more or less comfortable , permanent , chairs , so much like you here , team , and after the front of look , and listening .
there 's but music , because you can not actually sit still .
and we have us with is done , how can this , to see .
if you differently , sit and wondering , to a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , hear them automatically be different meaning .
still use to come out that we wrong with this concert does n't a stage had , goods , but four stages of them to the audience way around .
the audience could form , yes <unk> .
so , sitting there to the the night every once in the front row .
important for us this is that we 're not only just any <unk> do , but that we of the music of thinking .
that we , so questions that spaces and the atmospheres way around , but also in the minds of the people need the music that they do so that work can see how they 're going to speak to me to do ?
and so come up and then concerts by night , to a <unk> clock only 30 in <unk> , the s 's actually just one of <unk> lit be , in clubs , on <unk> , in the old <unk> .
but not just the spaces way around and the illumination can make music that is , will let and currently , but also the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy , that we 've been a few years with the <unk> work together , the with us dances , or movement to music to <unk> develop a , not actually the dance . been written is .
and so come up and then <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> from steve get rich .
and in this year we 've gone a , yes , if you so i want to <unk> would do it .
we have to the first time a concert together with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story from the soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , dancers , <unk> and that i just <unk> going to a <unk> <unk> .
that has do so , as well , for that works , because we have a big <unk> had to the us in this piece supported by .
we have about a <unk> much money from people from very , germany has brought them back , so that we that <unk> could .
at all is this film festival into something that came from a community that out of structure .
we 're totally happy in the near of <unk> in the town in <unk> a home and evolved to have .
the city , which is that 's exactly like this big that we great spaces and compelling places for concerts for finding , but also that small , that we have to be .
if the beginning of the year in the spring , two weeks forty <unk> from very europe in the city are , then drops on just saw that the town , more people with <unk> walking around as we usually .
at the big film festival is volunteering that organized .
we makers , are a very colorful mixture of students and students , and doctors , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really totally completely mixed up .
and to find a <unk> a <unk> <unk> that matter the <unk> or a coordination , and funding in the eye you keep , <unk> wondering , seven to 10 makers in a <unk> on to the for a year so that you tasks are taking .
is , they also , volunteering , but they care , hard for a year 's why , that for instance , that <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> in this is something hands are and the way to film festival , organized to be .
we do that all in our leisure and live in all of germany and distributed .
that is , the largest single part of labor of thousands , <unk> and on a <unk> .
just three times in the year we meet us about this year and distributed to a different extended weekend , <unk> to discuss that have a or other problems , the show up are , and caring for this is also interpersonal each other thing that is just surface and it matters , if you something as in motion . ♫ i want .
to the film festival , even come then two decades until only 30 volunteers , the first to tell us , the for a few days or a few weeks , their hands to bring into and there touch , where the help you needed is , the can <unk> , the can <unk> , the can <unk> , the can <unk> .
and of course , in these fourteen days to get the musicians around to .
now you could you mean , so right now you have everything else you for so a film festival needs .
but our <unk> goes further . .
we have , which is in <unk> in the city 's a large community of them to get around us , built like , you , that we can be supported in the top of what we want to make .
that goes from the classic <unk> go , and that goes , but also about very practical things like the example of the <unk> , because we have a baker , the us with the bread <unk> or a <unk> , the us , fresh food available to work out .
that <unk> is in a <unk> in the city there , over the whole year , made and sells .
goods to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole series <unk> found that takes us their living available to imagine going to make the musician , there samples can .
and this how and the way that 's the film festival , to something that enable us in this city has become and from the people in this city .
they identify now , there 's a very particular way , and the way with this film festival .
since the beginning of the year we began to thank <unk> support of the citizens in front of place a <unk> launched in a call , the right now this entire endeavor , on a <unk> and reliable <unk> turns out .
we makers , from the stage , believe that classical music <unk> , provided you come in the right hands .
therefore we are incredibly happy about , that in all of europe , young musicians , music in their own hand , take and home , in an alien , in the cities <unk> this right .
if you . they can now we still not so right can imagine , like incarceration , that feels , classical music , so people to experience then they come , but we just over .
start next year , we 're back in <unk> and we would really excited to , if you then also there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
what you think you may have the proud .
you know what you need to lead to the learning or to the effect of learning , but i mean , and have to learn heard it , a lot more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
you know , with an experience of time <unk> , a nice about formula for the <unk> .
what i of art and culture learned what you have , well , because i can not a lot of course to say , because in now ar : am suggesting <unk> i yes , in this field .
and why i have to me , i thought , that it might get really would , this is something <unk> title of a different <unk> still going to give , what my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , power , but much work .
they 've also now we were laughing .
you what you 'll always the laughter , though the most of the saying , know .
why is n't that ?
i think , that has to do with , that in the word . if something <unk> , what we 're not so right means we can .
art , say that we also , sometimes , that has what .
now to work , we say that less often , that has what .
sometimes as well .
the people , the like to work , that has what for me .
but in her work , i think we tend to the day of <unk> and it at the art , rather , among the rich , beyond the head of everyday , where we 're inside of us move , our experience to collect , our own thoughts and develop .
and so i have my <unk> , the i do you now you tell you want , in about three hours in five to move into a split , the all the headline have , with a i of starts going to make it for you very simple is .
it starts with the <unk> , for the childhood , goes on going to the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth to do n't worry , goes then went on , the word <unk> explain what i do afterwards , why i think that for my <unk> taken of have .

intense one of you will this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian stream , know .
<unk> to be two and <unk> .
you learn them so in the first two , three years , you 've done reasonably puts , and i 've done reasonably practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have these little pieces was playing , on the piano , not far from here , off the <unk> , to home .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there is a melody playing and the different voice <unk> , yet it 's very differently .
the rhythm is that is , the same , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial to see that the art that it really succeeds , and if it only two votes are , <unk> put together , together to think if that the present , the future , the past , sometimes is , in of works , images , in <unk> , in <unk> , things that the <unk> are , on the moment to bring together , the power of art from .
and i have , and learned , two distinct melodies , sometimes as well , three , the homes <unk> <unk> , at the to play , any kind yet to hear , the one to highlight , that wo n't .
so that was , what i because i learned what you have , under else .
a another experience , i 've never forget and i quit the worry suppose that it comes to me today , maybe this , which go to be alive .
i piano <unk> , it were still more people in the the hall than here today , and the middle of in the <unk> i came out .
i did it 's forget .
i brought her name was played .
so again at the beginning , starting and her to the same in , i knew , again , not on .
the audience has more and sweated , almost as i , because i went in spite of quiet on my place , i brought my notes , he put them to do , and started the third time at the beginning .
and they believe that 's not , like the me <unk> 've got behind .
but that was having a very immersive experience .
maybe it was that 's also a the experiences , where i then i knew , well , with the piano , although i then quickly as a <unk> had , i should perhaps not my 's spent go , because in trying to talk you can easier to cheat .
yes , the next the next chapter in my adolescence , i yes <unk> with the inspiration and also because i want you tell stories .
when i then so <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and she told him , rather , mr. <unk> , i want to be in a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver , that does n't do .
there have to you very many of our coffee , going to have and very much experience with women raised all have .
now imagine , you want time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , so a sentence .
the i sort of course not forget .
and of , everything else , i mean , i still more adept at .
well now i was the way too . '' and to time in a <unk> .
i practiced , and i remember what happens to a situation , i went so never more experienced , to have .
it was that <unk> of dress of chopin , and now i 'll close to the right-hand part of work , i have a moment in just not shared by , and they was with the most beautiful spot to , very broad range of you had the poor do , and then went that back together and back apart .
i could it now unfortunately , not in front of play , is not a piano , here , and i could it also not anymore .
i have this moment in two decades , only 30 times a row playing and suddenly i came you right .
and i then they keep playing and <unk> , i was doing in a complete ecstasy playing , and i know , only still suggesting that 's when i suddenly on the ground quit and laughing .
i was , except me .
i had nothing to finish , nothing taken , and the music has this with me doing this .
an experience , where i 've learned , emotions , also really allow that .
and sometimes it 's also a way , this was going to work , that you in this <unk> <unk> , in this constant state , i call it 's time , '' of <unk> .
where all of themselves involved .
we had this situation , would be then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was we then almost anything like of myself , when we the <unk> made , has the only about two months took us , where you usually a half years for would need .
so , that were my experiences with the piano , with the art , yes , with an artistic work .
and now i 'll close to my student -- , <unk> .
i was first , even when musicians and his way , but let me just as <unk> .
we have <unk> playing , <unk> , <unk> .

in the choir singing , let 's all breathe , a <unk> singing , as a great experiences , made me very , on , enlighten , have .

which is the art of culture to get there , to my <unk> to do .
so here to work for the art , but just might not as artists , but , otherwise would you yes , not say <unk> , but rather than <unk> move forward and keep trying to do .
i was there in the theater and have taught me <unk> , there 's been in germany , still no <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , there is i <unk> , and from point on , i remembered more and with this question is busy , what you can do anything to art to give the space to the framework for art to improve to pick a good management , a good management to set ?
and that was the reason , why i then also did n't stop 'm in my workforce , in towards this <unk> , and with <unk> years -- i was yes , then <unk> .
but before that was a other <unk> , and this phase , i yes <unk> with interactions .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my c.v , because i in <unk> born was , every time it says , the <unk> oliver <unk> , about my pet , what i , i have to the kind of time <unk> .
but i 've now , but a <unk> root , because my grandparents and maternal were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the <unk> experienced .
that was me before the more something , what i 'm not as the privilege of have , and suddenly -- i was sucked in a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture , the place history was of people in this in this <unk> this device made the <unk> .
once the <unk> on us was coming , were all in a very another situation , all over the other states of .
and i then with <unk> <unk> , the the field for <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the my friend and colleague who was , because then we have always for the <unk> night , music done , he had guitar , i piano , still a other has a bass , played , for instance , i could be at her name <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done , so , but of course , on text . '' of <unk> <unk> , for months practiced .
and this <unk> , that came really from the people out .
it was my destiny , that i was in the ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> n't start with me , and the wall fell .
i woke up the next day on , i had an oral exam , oh , the wall is really like , yeah .
have taught me still very quickly that i 'd been saying , on any questions , to <unk> .
and ab : there was i <unk> for the cities in the east germany .
and it 's where i again , experienced , like the interaction as social interactions are going on between two germans cultures .
actually speak , we did the same language , the music is going to go there , wonderful and was wonderful playing , but a lot of it was <unk> , <unk> .
different than the <unk> it came not from the people all of myself , but it came so much of the top , and that i 've seen as a big lesson from it felt , here to experience , like the german , as well , i thought that i 'll come later on time still time back , naturally , slowly in orbit broken , has and the german <unk> then these two states together all levels .
since . '' which is germany , yes <unk> .
since then is also on the federal much more <unk> placed .
interaction , i then , but in front of all things here we learned and experienced , in the city of food .
we have of the first place that i had the way , a <unk> , imagine , you want the time ago , when i 'm here 's get started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and spare time .
i have the still .
and play catch up for <unk> , you do n't want to write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was , which is the first ceo of years of the <unk> .
so i play in not so much so , anyway , that was wonderful that i do this <unk> had , but they have disappeared , soon , because i then for education in charge and was so that fixed alliances are able to education do and build this could .
we have very much for the urban design done , we have the if you only time that is an analog in between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see , what we and there was designed to have to the <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between one of works and architecture see that we can , from <unk> to the <unk> the side of blue rocks .
many , interactions , we were and i could create , and i 've experienced , and begun to what that means , if different people from different areas together a target to track .
they memorize the way that i do more and <unk> of the art , more and to the culture , the us believe is that takes us that <unk> between humans , between cultures , between those communities , better said , in the track of taking and i come , but afterwards , on the art back .
interaction that was also then between the <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea that had to the plane would be , january <unk> , that <unk> might naturally , the radiation <unk> europe and apply them .
but this last chapter that is a fifth chapter one has yet the headline identification .
this word has yes , two primary meanings , one thing , , i <unk> me with something , <unk> me so to something , and i put it , but also as verb , use and say , i <unk> something that means , i know thyself something .
and it 's this is always in his <unk> .
i know thyself something with his <unk> , therefore i say , i <unk> you , or the or that community .
and i <unk> me with something , when i sit around to <unk> and say , that you wanted to me , based on that i want to identify .
and that 's a very big action been .
five decimal point three million people are trying to to move , <unk> cities , naturally , to identify in a double the sense , to <unk> and to see , that you a community is in europe .
as big , we have it then <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people , the in a big farmland , life and yet at least a common language to talk , even when <unk> nations are here and this was our frontier , the positive identification , to <unk> done in the people and of you course , too much a ride .


there , ham , has <unk> <unk> and eat , two schools , has worked , young girl from <unk> , any of the <unk> , and boy , students from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , have letters of people , young men , from <unk> going to a play ? data structure , the home , say goodbye , love , death , the last letter that have written .
and it was already a , special effect , that young girl letters from young <unk> quoted , and boy , the russians and using letters from young men from germany in something <unk> german .
and there sits down , it’s a kind of these young men who come to the piano , and playing these <unk> , the i was so loved .
and tunnels , oh , then he quoted ; he from a letter , and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him , looking at home , as young german , the he played , and i can never more a <unk> play , because my my two fingers on now <unk> are .
and he <unk> his finger , with a <unk> , sat down , they 've got back to come to the piano in this a play on <unk> carl , and trying to the <unk> to play .
and it was made it do n't .

we 've learned , in the <unk> that many people together something to move can , but in front of all things we 've learned that we sixties years in <unk> in peace of life and the culture of us like that connects to that we have n't even more than the minds go about , because we different languages to talk , that we interact with each identify , we give us , inside ourselves feel .
and that was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it 's about the can learn not just about the fact , something to know .
it 's about the can learn always been about , something to experience and <unk> won .
and if we much to innovate and invention , let this , <unk> , if we do it does n't tolerate that we keep us inspire and let of art and culture , our own right position to relate , in dialogue with the artwork , if we interact and finally , too our own identity and tried to work , by we interact with art and culture to question , let me , then we all have won
and i hope is , they still many <unk> and <unk> have , from where they are those profit to places .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think , we wait on the first picture that matter .
so i have to <unk> to the support of my memory . here so a few slides <unk> .
it are , but no scientific slides , but it goes in my <unk> here 's why , one direction to find and me with a subject of the way through , where i think , that 's going to us the next few years very significant implications are .

and then i had still have heard , that you can to talk , in english . ♫ i should , if somehow became possible , but , if you to that look , then you see , they would n't understand , what i in english going to say , i knew i was not directly , as i do it 's say that should and so , what i talk , then , but there on the german , they left .
how we will die .
i have to them there is first of <unk> tell .
<unk> was a patient in the the hospital , in the side , i the <unk> <unk> , and was <unk> .
they was about <unk> years old and has always like in the may to dance , because you that ends , her husband remembered that 's in the the first man , the in war by it was then .
and this is so they every year for the first , may rise to dance , you go and has long as a dance and probably even then a <unk> <unk> to a lot to finish , and then is <unk> and business , , here on the right-hand side you see this , the leg broken , the <unk> .
a few years earlier was they also been an even <unk> and , did on the same way , with equal occasion , already , once that the left leg is broken .
and then , i was also have already there as a doctor and you have more experienced , as you weeks of patients in that we look , as you with the antibiotics and treat it was , also , resurrects was , and what you have the discussion of walking around , as i 've been said , is because that does a sense ?
does it does a sense , held in this is how old people like this intense procedure , to the effort to earth ?
so <unk> , to <unk> , patients in for weeks , like this is a people at all <unk> ?
and they then is fixed been .
five years later i take the clinic , i see the name <unk> , and the , can i well , and notice , because he just so rare is , indeed , the time back then , and business , to investigate the dance in the may be back the other one leg is broken .
so that turns to start to the question , what <unk> i there 's actually , when i talk about this , as a person for . they can decide what to , what he was in his directives write , or what he ends , <unk> <unk> ?

you see here , then the <unk> , who 's called , how we will die .
it 's a book from of <unk> , how we 're working to be , a report the side of <unk>
and then , it was so , that the globalization are very close as little went to come and so you 're going to start asking who has , how is it because you go , it struck me to work ?
you has then , and that you can in this book now , but also still you read , just said , it is a quality control come , so that the parts always go together .
it is a <unk> the work that successes , it will also the work , still much stronger , but you see be , for instance , after china , but that was a big issue .
and this is then this , which has come out that basically the work of making individual , so something to assemble , something to paint , every time less , ending was that he 's always getting more control it was also of the quality , that he <unk> , of the accuracy .
and that , after my prior assessment , the people that matter less and confidence from their work , pull could and more and part of a little <unk> were , where it 's why they went to care as height of high <unk> to reach , and not more about the fact , through his work , too , to define .
and if we this now turned to on the <unk> and medical domain of , then there 's because of course , so just one development .
if you in television even hear , about , and doctors , nurses and also <unk> at the most not find them , you 're 's the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when there must go for be , what you has done , so it would <unk> 's going to make it even being paid is , and if not going to document is , then he says the the health service that i just as well , these care or this medical practice to pay we do n't .
and by these ones with which is , but the work of <unk> always getting more <unk> and more and is approaching , this idea , that you his work do it , and with the use of personal belief compound , the background to , and so a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a good friend of me is now after the netherlands , you go , because he showed this is not anymore , i wanted to the had a <unk> practice , has the given up and is after the netherlands , you go to knock your doctor for <unk> use .
the <unk> 're seeing with such developments in most a bit of that forward and he , the martin , had that i just experienced , that are more and old people swing between the the nursing , the hospital , to do , and back , because the <unk> not anymore , i knew , what they 're supposed to do , if it allows the people got worse , went .
then get the the hospital , will have restored to go back in my senior home , or a nursing , and be there on , <unk> .
and this your family , did that matter , i thought , if it this is something more structured them in holland , there , then i want to me because i 'd like train , let me to stand here 's something to promote , that you go out of this cycle of the <unk> and the children 's also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there , well , in holland , got had he however 's , after he the language with a lot worked hard as i 've had learned , that there 's exactly the same thing happens , what 's wrong with this <unk> had happened .
it will also the can die , increasingly a quality control in place .
it 's not anymore , the credibility that is what counts , but you are put even in a available to find , i want to the example , not be brought , or not the hospital , when i in a nursing 'm .
and then they do that <unk> .
in holland , it 's so , and the third of days , finds a conversation with the <unk> instead , and the need to then , it’s an issue , i want to the hospital or i do n't want more the hospital , when i 'm doing something happened .
so just with the , i want to be brought or i do n't want to be brought .
and again , go then clinging to a central and there 's sitting in this physician , for <unk> , has always the <unk> ago , naturally , and it 's coming then the decision on this kind of the .

and that was preparing for my friend now , the there in the netherlands is sitting , also very much <unk> , how he 's just to deal with me to do .
in the past it 's case that <unk> today about their sixties , until seventy percent of the people do n't even more to home to die , but in hospitals , rating , and that these rating , for that 's , so you do that are able to do n't the ideals of habitats these are for the old people , but it 's often a tightly financially closely <unk> scope there , the <unk> are often <unk> and the funding in and of incarceration , this <unk> find there , after my perception , just constrained by instead .

the whole has course <unk> reasons , this is very clear , this whole quality control , these control is , so we introduced , because in the last the money for it 's not enough , that all people , optimal , and in under way the scope of <unk> be and that the people , the the care deliver or the medical excellence , so they 're paid you to say , there was -- i well with a clear , because i can for instance , as a nurse a family of feed with one or two children .
this is today just not the reality , but you need two salaries , in <unk> and <unk> and mostly enough -- it then also had just .
this is if the quality control than a consequence of the time growing a market , the you to adjust ever want , it around the road , so we also on the individuals have kept getting out .
and now i take this working on how to the the maybe we can escape , so what do we now in the past , because i cried . yes , so first of questions asked , and eventually demonstrated , so very simple is the situation for individuals who do n't .
and it 's where i just time that <unk> <unk> and the articles on one of me , there <unk> , because i think , a society that it would always like this structure , including the legal structure to with which we looked at the <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> article in one letter is just said , that would be on the people 's <unk> .
and the second set up there is , you to protect it 's get their task of all <unk> .
and what i worry sometimes it 's missing , is still a third thing sentence in there were going to address that every one , neither of water , the commission will have to match , his was going to protect and to defend themselves .
because that a way is themselves , to be free from this case i , i give the edges of other way , and the supposed to me time somehow <unk> and feed and then i need that i was looking at least not thoughts about doing , as i because even die , let me .
because in the past , it is yes , and yet , so , even when we , this subject does n't like to ask , we will eventually , among the point , coming .
hopefully -- that you 're late , with a century or <unk> .
the equivalent of course of my career as well , to say , that wish i each and because i want , i also for about me , but eventually it will play , this subject to face , and if it then maybe so far is , or also just , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it can already late in life to be late in life be to say , i want about this question now once we can think .
if you now think about , what does mean i 'd made of them , you will you on the dots are coming , where then in the last come out , what are because actually the five most important things in my life has gone ?
because now there 's a book , what 's pretty en <unk> is .
it are the self-esteem of course , it are then the friends , that i , with which i 'm starting to go into and exchange can , made me know , and the me through the lives to be with , it are the <unk> .

and it are there , very many individual factors of course , that there <unk> , i leave the right now , not all through .

and then coming then , another one other factor that says , that we have a certain dictatorship in the <unk> experience , i picked this of times as if i text , or as a career as an example of that 's taken .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , which there <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
our would you can only from us even come out .
so it 's not the question , what will , because others to me to do , who 's going to me because time we feed , for babies , or road , for me to use them , who goes on me to be ?
but it 's exactly the other way , to ask , where i can on people , want , where you can i figured out into the and it made my inner would die of that i do with these questions to manage and to be me . there 's position and and around it can .
and if you then he says , how we 're working to be , so this inside this quality control , the us , though we put the was , it 's a way , to say , i is , how to me about my my inner would , this mechanism to get away .
because no man can tell me <unk> , as i bought myself , because you see , and position and you want .
and i must be there 's also do n't fit into in general <unk> or that 's out , the say , you got to now a directives like your and because you 've already that old , me , i 'm kind of you notice that i want to see if you be brought you would want to see if you on a intensive care would want .
these questions , that i can be in the last only to a long <unk> probably <unk> frontier .
this would be on the people 's an inner posture , the in me is well , and the not , though that we should be as a , the state , not protect you can , also a law , not , and the me also other people <unk> can and me , rather <unk> be , if i told me , for that there myself before with which we asked myself have you have more , so that the also know , what i for a person i 'm .
and if to find these conversations to lead , it going to leave you spaces , and because i think , and it 's why i have this talk about this is called , and here in front of preparing for , are doing these spaces like that <unk> in the food , that i put them here , both to model , on a picture times <unk> , spaces , where we over these subjects to think we need to , where a , or more room is , so that it does n't hurt this is that 's also may not to in theory is , but that even a conversation , there is actually happening .

i thank you welcome for listening .
beautiful good evening .
i 'll go into two things with .
if you the first part to flat , is to hold , you want a little <unk>
it comes , another 's imagine .
we start with the infinite , together .
that 's stupid , not , can take you .
what my you ?
there 's and different <unk> ?
or is an infinitely big enough ?
yes !
this is not good , if you is a bit and is , the what 's looking !
so , , indeed , but i <unk> it . ab , for the message that you know it .
that 's exactly what we do n't .
we engage us with just by one .
and i frontier that would like a little too . '' to the finite planet .
<unk> , finite , we know , to which we form of us a to know .
and it 's searching for the <unk> the pieces of magnitude of vast amounts .
if we in a finite our way are , and if you just two <unk> , in a matter of the example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , suppose , already now , we need to look in the box and practice , the number is small , it are three , chairs and it are three people .
we can we 're checking , whether in any amount of the same amount of elements in it 's ?
count , how would we 're doing it ?
that is , we would just at the people <unk> , one , two , three , we do they get three , we count the chairs , see three , chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and wonderful .
that my you , yeah ?
very good .
this works in a finite wonderful , that you can also lies in large numbers , though it sucks .
but it fits .
how you can do it 's still had that ?
how you can still going to check , that so many people like chairs , there are ?
i 'm aware , chairs and people were taken and not what else .
<unk> let me !
you called the couples !
you very well , that this is clear , not , now we 're in their daily our way , and it certainly understand that 's also all !
not something that 's very good .
so , you that 's called also a professional a <unk> and it works , as well , yeah ?
you take a , location of them on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , way , the next <unk> , everything is operating , different people get these different , chairs , not a chair with is abandoned and the eruption of these are the same size , okay .
now we go into the infinity .
how do we have two to which massive amounts each other 's conceivable ?
we 'd say , the one is that big or bigger or smaller than the other .
we could we 're doing it ?
we would be back to start to .
alright , that 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite number of a long lot to start to count , yes , i 'd time just say , you get not to another .
<unk> , forever , is clear , <unk> ?
so , which is how do it ?
madame ?

they had this yet , for that gets really started !
they mate !
so , now we can look at this time to time .
and guess , we estimate is in the infinite always bad , yeah ?
you see , yes , you see , yes , no end , yeah ?
the point is , but here , you cook it easy .
if i for instance , the <unk> take her , natural numbers , <unk> , we computer scientist who need the zero in the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we could have to say we time , a copy of this <unk> and take care of this xeroxed piece of the infinity in many <unk> pay a way .
left to stay in the just numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all straight numbers are <unk> on the infinite number of a long band of the natural numbers , but on the a band missing the <unk> , on the other people are the straight and the <unk> on it , okay .
we call the a lot , g , the straight to pay , we call the other lot n , the natural numbers .
what you think ?
this is , g powerful , it 's bigger than n , the same size or smaller ?
and in a big ?
this is , but very high handling , yes , in the top of a missing , yes , the <unk> .
who are having a different estimate . ab ?
smaller ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , that has yes , actually really do n't plan , yeah ?
this ca : yes , also not be , yeah ?
you ca : yes , not , where what 's missing , bigger , guess that 's not that , <unk> ?
okay , they say , smaller ?
would you assume , not ?
this is the conventional wisdom , what you suspected , course , is wrong .
and now , and now to explain what i why the eruption of the same conclusion .
and how does do it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the straight lot , we take the zero from the natural lot , mate , out .
the next the zero , after , plus two of it 's two , after the zero to come from the one , and i 'll get back a <unk> .
the four , the two , the six , the three , the eight , the four , yeah ?
you can that 's also the reverse , then is a 's doubling , this is clear , <unk> ?
and completely clear that is , by the <unk> do we make it 's why that i do what 's always in the lecture and so a <unk> <unk> .
and here , one , there are just the straight on it and the band is the same as long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural on the straight , <unk> , the <unk> are way , and the band is still buy a long .
that there 's it just in the infinite .
so if you any chance to explain what we have today i learned to have the infinity learned , yes , which is because it forever , i know , just finally ?
an infinite amount of has a property , that 's real in a finite to leave you do n't and this trait that says , is an absolute <unk> , a real subset of the events exactly that big is .
that 's make them in a finite not , if you from three three people are two people <unk> , then it 's only still a there and before they were a 's three .
yes , so that we have the infinity in the time .
it 's none of links ?
okay .
then do we still a second part , the odds .


wrong with this experiment i 'm extremely sure , is a 's at least a third know , and <unk> it does anybody with , the that on it has , yeah ?
so , we call the doors , a boca , b , c .
i 've got behind anything you were hidden , i hope that you has a 's not heard .
and they should now we 'll find a guess .
where , my you , i have anything you were hidden , behind a boca , b , or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate it on a c .
who still has one another idea ?
a to ?
who still has an idea ?
<unk> , <unk> , b has been missing , not , otherwise you hear the yes , never going on , <unk> ?
so it 's right .
it 's really completely different matter , so you must not my , the three of letters , will fall and i 'm looking for me one .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes , completely clear , because there that the chance to keep them as it has been blessed to have , is yes , as it has only at a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i do it 's what , i just do one on .
well , i of course , where it 's up .
<unk> , the business , anybody here , <unk> .
so , i know , yes , where it 's up , and the best guess , and appreciate that , or how do anything that you do it 's called , goes in a second round .

so it 's so , we go in a second round .
now , suppose , i <unk> me on this a , <unk> ?
so , now i have to a door to show up behind the n't it 's up and that they do n't have said .
because , if you now , b to say , and i say , and i know , yes , it is yes , not behind the b .
then there would it , yes , not a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , she got a little better .
but i have to yes , that 's <unk> , in the second round go .
so i can just an open the , behind the it 's not just not is , but what they also do n't have said .

they must now , unlike a to stay , then i do is necessarily a , on .
i 'm doing now this on , what they want to have .
or they say , i 'm doing , c , on .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this knowledge likely to become evolvable ?
phew , very beautiful , b is on , now i know , it 's behind , c .
or , but , god is right now , thanks to continue to b is open been is , i always wanted somebody in a to stay , this is it .
or would you now say , is yet <unk> , we have , <unk> , way , so , we 've only still two doors , now it 's no matter , to change , or to stay .
what my you ?
it 's not matter .
<unk> .
why is it does n't matter ?
very good .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , yes , that 's wrong .
this seems yes , almost , as if we do it yesterday <unk> have said , <unk> ?
but so they are , <unk> , are a new well , no fun .
so , so , this , the thing is very <unk> , yeah .
that get all sorts between , i actually do n't , six and , yes , i would be not their sixties years , else can i else does n't even more part , <unk> ?
so , it <unk> really everyone .
behind this door is because it to a third .
and it 's always just to a third person behind a door .
you can guess , what they want , they have with two thirds . you would be in the dirt .
that is , like they can on two doors to guess , not something that you ca : yes , in my belief in <unk> do , you ca : well , on two dozen put them , you 're it , yes , <unk> , given the zero time i transferred to that there 's and yes , everything in real life .
but here we 've just a door .
so , now is so , this , two thirds of it 's not , what you guess .
so much is the two thirds of here , but it can now , but just behind a door , who are !
behind the rate is a 's not !
so , which is then more likely ?

so , which is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stick , or a solution to ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , of course !
so , that was now not hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they have she got a little better .
why ?
very simple , as well , two thirds are not a hundred percent : the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope that it was for every which goes along .
thank you .
mr. <unk> you to me after jamie oliver <unk> , the here 's just come from this is no diet and bad food and overweight people 's news has , this depressed a yes , completely .
but i whistle , ' my best thing that we see , which everything again the way is , this some insights .
i come ' is a lot of <unk> farm and i knew , until i 12 was n't make any of mcdonald 's .

, yeah .
very much , thanks for the references you today .
i 'm here in the ones , grew up .
and i do n't know , whether you sir <unk> also , therefore on it came to me to ask , if i , during the ted , at the lake join you want and over a particular topic want to talk .
i picked up to me <unk> <unk> : the theme of trust .
i realized , motivation is also not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> , despite the has said , maybe it makes the a or another , later , more sports .
if only i also full of this is to have .
so tonight is of what the rain still do jogging , to go would now <unk> much in order , but i have to make tomorrow , indeed to train , because i in three weeks at the <unk> june , at the <unk> , of <unk> after the intended to drive want with 'm half a bike -- that are <unk> miles .
is likely to me , is , tomorrow , during the rain this training do n't get freed up .
so who have a ride want to <unk> , it go tomorrow , early on here , in <unk> , i <unk> ' they all welcome to a .
i cried . ' types already said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> the issue of trust .
and i cried . ' started to get through , with the subject <unk> .
do n't worry , the nice , little <unk> , the blind faith to come up afterwards <unk> .
i cried . ' before me a second thoughts and over it did , when i <unk> 'm home to describe what i would be the where i <unk> ?
so , i come from 'm half the village with six houses , you very <unk> , some <unk> and what in my parents lying on the farm there 's and apple apples , <unk> and <unk> -- and what , you make <unk> : and beer .
trust , in sports , of course not in <unk> but stick with me : <unk> and beer .
why use in ' i the story , from where i ?
for me is one of the very important stories , that i really that right from the country , from village , come ' and there up , i 'm with two big brothers , with the oldest brother , the <unk> is .
and do with the brother , the same way blind is like me .
mean , the see light and dark , the can see how i just might also recognize , where <unk> window in space , whether it 's and light to see that 's or from .
what today , very convenient is for the heaters .
the , or we both can just might see , when the front of us anything you is .
'n pole , but i said , tell ' always i ca n't tell , is <unk> man <unk> pole .
the necessary to the subject of the old men , <unk> .
always been talking to go this tapping into .
and what for me , but always very was critical , course , is already the fact , how it 's written you trust and what you 'll just looked at this great confidence , that <unk> , that we all need to <unk> as something <unk> situation , , tell i time .
and that was for my parents definitely , that you how many of them , in front of my brother and me still does n't even blind people knew .
we were so the first , the then a quite a sudden in their lives <unk> are .
and then they had to from the situation , kind of what do .
and , now <unk> i , it 's a giant fortunate that my parents than farmers are not the whole day long time had the next to us to stand and us , among the hand to lead , or to say : there is <unk> wall , there <unk> , do you time , along and you can , then <unk> feel , where you 've <unk> .
a , that would be awkward been -- we 've got home so <unk> .
and b , ham , our parents of the beginning , among us that we were encouraged , always get there to go , where we also our sighted brother is .
so , in the home alone <unk> , the <unk> going down and <unk> , it also time to risk .
there has the blind brother me to happen to 'm half <unk> <unk> farm , by , <unk> followers and practice .
the order to get the order to get i have to today still .
so is that with the big brothers -- that are not only good for the elbow , but also for the <unk> .
and our brothers and and my brothers and i we ham , on 'm half a courtyard , for that really that all the outside did , what ma , ' one you could make , mostly the example of bike , drive .
and that has the <unk> brother , with the desire started with three years , and then we wanted course also -- michael and i .
and have then started , with <unk> to drive , how early in many little kids , today with the wheel is about the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have that still getting started with <unk> doctor , without .
and then is the big question : how will get on behalf of water , there ?
and how do you get that trust , one hand , that trust the parents , that the children also some stage back from the bicycle light from and <unk> and other thing that trust of us , that we 're not permanently , where it came out to drive .
and our solution was , that we obviously a , of our parents tell us have let , where are the <unk> , so where is , as a car , where <unk> followers , where are you may also time i became very unfamiliar , things , clear these homes -- that turns you now , not the way -- because we knew , so they are .
and we had to us between , choosing to us that one hand , notice , but the other hand , also hear .
and that they can now , in here , unfortunately , not all of testing , because someone else is a 's here so according to keep them it 's nothing more of view .
but <unk> ' evening when they have time a 's light switch off and wondering , in their bedrooms , or in whose bedroom anything that then they orient to want .
they can time trying to just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , so , naturally , to orient and they will find that , that 's stick with us humans as is in using bats are also -- they 're going to a resistance to hear .
so how the bats that so with <unk> will also you hear , now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance , because the sound just looked at different <unk> will .
and this is for me in trust , so trust and also in the movement , always very important been .
now , but <unk> care as high <unk> to have and the safety saying , i cried . ' <unk> chance to me because <unk> piece to help .
and me just described to orient to no big trouble and i realized , as well , without many accidents , the a or other , there 's face of course , already .

which is from climb on our higher building on 'm half a courtyard .
i cried . ' here 's written : the confidence , grows as well , through a <unk> diversity .


i realized , but when you are also to do with that it is obviously not everybody so what used experimentally to experience can .
and diversity is in the figure out of our strengths with the announcing to pick some point to know , where i a good , what i figured talent and where i can just looked at my strengths and actually also full <unk> ?
and our brother , for that again , the chance , michael and i 've always the way down on the roofs off the house .
so i realized , then he said : okay , we ham , here 's a <unk> .
because you reach anywhere from 'm half the window <unk> of the <unk> , for example .

but in the end : who stays like the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i think i made ' the other in , we 're yes , the next generation of young women , here , also not .


because of trust is the most of course , then the way , when others to rule .
i would have the father so well , the order to god will , to help to help to help , then if only ' the risk of a quite big been used to make a kind of us as well , by the tip have said , and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i actually do n't -- kind <unk> would be .
is that they ' but never happened .
he had to form , then always been so <unk> that he 's us to leave you also again , slowly <unk> has or by johannes <unk> has , the us , then returned from .
and that i found ' i for me very great , that we have opportunities that had .
but i realized , do n't worry , this is no value proposition , not necessary to get you later <unk> to do .


so to <unk> good <unk> i would have never be able to .
for that i had never the <unk> .
and i go , ' to date n't like in <unk> .
i go , ' to date , to be out in the rain .
now as well , not in five degrees , like the moment .
and what in <unk> rain -- but nevertheless , rather than the inside be .

as the first , for example <unk> .
and that was for me very beautiful , because there is also the coach , the us in <unk> had , has said : okay , we have that is , louder <unk> children , but they send it ' us <unk> couple of blind children .
actually about it , yeah well , because there she grabs you 're wondering , anyway , each other at the coats .
and then you notice , yes , what the other people power .
and there was always been so my big trust , of course , i mean , when i can to follow-up competition long to take place , i 'll is a 's hard , because then you can the other perhaps , but the time , what do , what i do n't <unk> ' .
so there 's it just a method : and this is the faith in my strength , .
the other grab a foot in the <unk> imagine , i find yourself backwards fall , let , the <unk> head that 's , and then it 's sitting in the back and the a competition is over , because it 's and the full score , there .
i 'll figure 's and this is n't try it .
i did it me , i thought , but <unk> .
i think i made ' , this is now <unk> bit risky .
and that looks like i 've also now here 's not have volunteers , right ?
<unk> .
shit , i <unk> ' already .
okay .
the next for me , important was when you got in the school , for that then the <unk> and that i just <unk> .
my parents were home or are until today <unk> and that you have us also have taught me as children .

and there , i had then as a way in the school <unk> to do .
and although i actually always thought : that 's all so , ' <unk> boring , because <unk> is that they are like for the <unk> rather , <unk> ' i .
i found ' i used -- <unk> ' i now not anymore .
i figured , then eventually said : well , i 'll do with the can <unk> .

<unk> -- you may have a lot to also of their work recognized ?
this is this it also in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you just looked at the thing you have faith in the own technology has .
if you that confidence in the own mark of has -- so the power , that you the men 's also , then , every other conditions , to investigate the bad weather , the can yield the snow , the can <unk> snow and also on the skiing and when we can .
and if you in my case just might also have faith in the team has .
because when <unk> , the nothing can see , i a course wheelchair-bound <unk> <unk> .
and me is still have n't like , the <unk> happens like today -- i have to the word to use -- my <unk> -- because there 's and yes , just one -- has already today even my exercise was done .
power , but nothing , we do you yet again .
specifically , i <unk> 's and you now maybe just time .
but do with a , a , one of you see , which still a different kind of practice .

the can <unk> <unk> yes , this : you has two sticks in my hand .

n't do .
so i have to me different helping .
i quit and then my <unk> the coolest , the front of me running .
and the explain me with the voice , the route .
so the needs to me just always the exact <unk> do .
and also that 's important for trust .
the precision somewhere in the communications , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tells me that i just always <unk> , if it 's and <unk> goes , the tells me <unk> and <unk> , despite the says , then : the left on the 11 , then i know about it gets pretty easy to left , so what happens at the upper part of the quaint clock , with the pointer .
when he says , left on top 10 little sharper to left , and when he says , right on a decade .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i have to make another <unk> or he had to me again , i think again , then i personally , so this , now is true , what do n't .
and for me is yes , the very large , critical , if the <unk> ago me running , then i have to me the the really completely <unk> to find a 's time , negative to say .
so to a 's positive way to say : he 's for me that tool , that 's me to take place , men 's really , and then quickly to be and in <unk> also faster than others , the in the same a competition to start .
and that i can only , if i have a 's going to just manage , with both arms to me <unk> to me <unk> , on a leg , to stand and i must now really the eyes to make -- ha ha , or `` can you also open , let , to `` yes , nothing .
and must then you saw . so <unk> and must then on the other one leg and the same way back to stand and they give me here <unk> bit in further , but i have to really care as quiet and look .
also with high shoes .
yes , and this is for me that very critical , when i the can <unk> 'm just quickly : how <unk> i 's it , the the guy to say , so i , tell the guy , because i actually just men as <unk> had , how do one i 's and the the one you to say : hey , you got to me the right <unk> do , because the clear , the it : yeah ourselves .
the know so not , what he told me to say to .
so i get one that 's a , him the way for communications that i just open to worry .
and that 's like in any <unk> .
if anyone in my needs n't know them , he can tell me of course not help , but there i just might ask you , and must say : well , i got nowhere . ' of you from the rate , maybe <unk> <unk> used firm .
or i got nowhere . ' of telling you like now , during the walking , that their worries me just might also time she says , how long , ' the mountain like , it is , because if we the <unk> <unk> , because when you think , yes , at some time : now , it has now , but over , be .
and kick in again and practice like nuts and that thing we want you just not on .

of that 's why is that for me already important , there 's also the grain of , accurate <unk> have them .
i 'm like , ' <unk> -- here there 's and i think any other , the also <unk> <unk> driving ?
who she offers more ?
so my best of time was already times faster , but that was in september , and now so in april , may , till i was a 's true story told you still never been so much faster , did not like <unk> .
and the homes uncanny the moment very <unk> .

the other me just might also exactly explain , what he comes to . they can see , and i 'm so the possibility that there , my risk , perfectly estimate .


because i also been in the experience we had to continue to me a <unk> right , and left is wrong firm i had .
and then was this is what the a competition and at the bad , because it 's `` the next to the way across three feet <unk> .
and i am the three feet , for that <unk> .
of , and so -- as i said , but that was -- of course <unk> prices on .
that i know that 's , because the <unk> must naturally , yes , turn around , to , so <unk> <unk> .
and i think about it happening today still be permanently , that i think about people say : the left and say , then : <unk> , the other left .
so i was then , but the right , unfortunately .
power in the everyday life often not so much like .
but i realized , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you know , probably also all of the work or the university , like anything that if a 's time quickly go to worry .
and then it 's kind of course , precision , often , yes <unk> <unk> difficult challenge .

and because i must be honest , say , i am more than anyone , the n't see , a quite big in the advantage , because i <unk> ' that i took risks in many ways .
so the can <unk> <unk> ' i now so pretty all .
from the driving <unk> tree , from falling into the slope , down <unk> , the know , and i and i <unk> ' but of course -- and this is yes , that important -- i <unk> ' also the good pages .
that is that i then also did get to return , if that trust me just arrived .
and if you see somebody has found , the men 's actually also a hundred percent , so <unk> , as i a 's just might need .

because this is for me in the subject of trust me just the next , very critical .
you need the same goal and i have to me just really also clear to be , which is about it because actually , trust and also gives us ?
because of consciousness is often <unk> faster the term , the you time i used .
i have confidence , the way or the or i think about ourselves .
but the very key thing is yes , already , that this fact , too much depend on .
that you do that is that you for trust a lot <unk> .
and that you yes , also -- because we people all with <unk> <unk> <unk> meet -- we want <unk> that sense to see .
and the sense , the is very often , that we just might also create , 'n goal together to achieve .

and there <unk> ' i right : i have to me now , someone who seek out , the characteristics or the i put in the case , so you can count , that i just looked at this mountain also up that i get .
and how do you know that the then , that you go on the mountain also at some really up there 's shirt ?
well , i mean , i had course , the giant advantage , i cried . ' some things right now we did n't see , if it 's it for instance , next to me a hundred meters <unk> .
and then i was me that 's relatively unknown , .
ca <unk> advantage to be , then it 's kind of heights , which is no problem .

this is already <unk> bit <unk> , if you then up there 's come and down the cars can hear , then you have to still not time a lot see to stand there to know , now , does it 's it hurts , when i <unk> .
and things like that are for me and less interesting possession .

and that 's what <unk> <unk> bit of the can <unk> , because somebody in <unk> mountain <unk> yes , so , you 've all about every day , 10 hours ago , hard to do , and it 's some stage just hold still get to the
you about that , and goes and has only still stones , to a little , moving around , less and plants .
you take at the <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun of ago i 'm half the first world war and ted has .
so if you <unk> <unk> see , then is the <unk> about the last , the the <unk> .
the necessary if only then so that the only an exciting .
we have the <unk> just from the distance ever seen or the other one you .
of therefore <unk> ' i there <unk> big faith in the <unk> -- despite his silly <unk> , that he , man had .


and the really exciting is 's and then , if yes , so on , difficult is .
so if you then in the dopamine <unk> and the air to be thinner is .
or if a 's next to a come off , if you then <unk> little <unk> has , where it 's and left and right to come off .
then is a 's particularly beautiful and if it 's and then also still accounting night is , and all with <unk> <unk> , then you arrive at us the <unk> already , sometimes we also said : now would he told me , i 'd come to the wire just take , so that he then i was also really in the view , and in the grip of mind .
because i is the only without <unk> there <unk> and that was him , then , but sometimes to be risky .

but i got nowhere . ' also <unk> form of security , so that i think i 'm not permanently , focus has to , because : they can imagine , if you on the mountain was always say <unk> stone , right to focus on one , left on the 11 .
there will you look at some <unk> world , which all .
so for us is confidence in the the case , historically , which we 're <unk> connection , so ham , we have a rope , among your backpack to mention , that i had in my hand , and i 'm then behind her desk , the top of loosely <unk> rope has gone .

and you is then eventually , only still 're , with the foot <unk> stone had spoken , or has with their <unk> <unk> stone <unk> , that i just might also have already knew , which is so on me the horizon , and as i 'm not permanently , for that focus had .
and what you know i looked at the men 's really has shown , how beautiful it actually is , you kind of course , i realized then eventually , simply because the the top of approaching , that you just looked at this goal really so again in consistency with human beings who has -- just said , like we also the can <unk> , with the <unk> .

but that trust is also lies in other , there , the <unk> , like trust me just works .
when we then at night , for that the mountain <unk> are , we were in the group , mostly , very forward and behind us are the other seven participants had walked and that were always were kind of dense behind us and it has been , everyone can pause it was somebody else behind us and . i 've already thought : tell ' time , why would remain the because why , looking , because i always everyone sees that it there behind us can run ?
at night beside you also the girls not from behind you look .
this is somehow not the reason to have been .

you goes there at night by the darkness , you is going to the number 12 years at going on these , then you 'll find no light .
this is totally fatigue , if you <unk> is , the air is being thin , so really only still fatigue and now , not more <unk> first place .

have all the night of us anything you 've told me and the other in the group had the right there 's just that this , which the recognition , <unk> to know , ok , it 's now just <unk> hour , that has they told me then told .
or i quit her what 's very different now not far from the mountain , telling .
and that to me to know , it 's still turn up there , the the it may also just bad things go <unk> about that we have perhaps the time i talked about -- it are only still <unk> hour , the sun goes soon on .
exactly those things , also have this open-heartedness , though it can trust , again significantly increase and can just goes around to contribute , that you so the personal medal just might also have achieved .
and it 's for me faith do so , then given , and it 's do so , then the perfect , if you saw . so the personal medal and that , what 's just that really achieve this is so , then eventually , also in the idea of the right there is .
this is course , all right in in sports , with the gold , in that you so <unk> -- i know that actually also not , why that 's go back to make -- maybe , i actually do n't anything to the value to test , or to check out , whether it 's and yet only to lead <unk> is ?
so i think i made ' belief in some , medals it 's so , what in vancouver , the were to six grams a hard .
if all this real gold would , then <unk> i 'm not here , then i would have on the <unk> , , get me .
now , or in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .


anyway , whether an old man or young woman , we need them , for that people , also in the we trust you can .
and if we then this goal in the head clear ago we have eyes and that 's also 've reached , then that is the best of evidence , that we look at least in a project in our lives of trust you could .
and you let 's and once you can , you can create a 's also , definitely in other areas .
very much , thanks .
a science for me , this is the title of my talks , the sort of , is after <unk> your nice maps .
which i was driving passions , is that the very <unk> effort that , the sciences , again as something <unk> in the general population to attach .
in this issue that could i 'm pleased to be .
if i in a <unk> <unk> , there 's and the whole <unk> only with the literature to science data subjects , the <unk> <unk> is .
even any <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where the major issues , collections of issues , somehow an act made the whole .
every student tv station has at least a <unk> , where i give a major issues that data structure will .
even , that 's totally <unk> , if you watch this , what it , those magazines and <unk> for children there with science data subjects .
every program has somehow , already a own off of in <unk> , but yet , is this is a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing , the the , can i 'd like you looked at the ones can i 'd like reading , but that the brain in me , yes , not themselves .
cool , cool is science just kind in mortality rate , csi to engage in breaking bath , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
what in csi so a <unk> five minutes , has anything at all with the reality to do , but that 's cool , <unk> ?
there , because i can see me that cause .
big bang theory of , because i can fly over the laughter , i understand the jokes , not , but it 's fine .
this is extremely too .
because , that 's kind of a little paradox , the the future will we just manage to engage with such a technological issues that and themes .
but at bay area that none of materials , and of the best .
i picked a few little taste of time i 've been doing , like science , or science , just stick with us that in a given to have .
a very <unk> example : in london , you have a nice little tower being built , <unk> , the architect , time , not so right now , we build the time somehow being so <unk> .
what happens is , now , they were going to the sunlight from up in this facade into view , i quit the time <unk> come out , , , totally focused , and then , somewhere in other <unk> , looking at a point centre .
that went big , by the press , stood there , unfortunately , just a jaguar .
so sad , the heat which , so <unk> , that this poor <unk> , the really long , long lives saved and eventually , there are the <unk> ' time .
there she asks you , it turns out so a danish architect , has the n't really kind of time , so a bit of what in physics have learned , because i mean , is yes , entirely new thing , that such a mirror and stuff is focused .
so , what i 've found , very new thing , is <unk> , sort of & front of christ , where he was supposedly , with the rays , a fleet of an innocent of mind .
there is and what i really , which has the more design or an architect , or where did he studied ?
now that 's a very <unk> example .
a classic , followed what is given such current on things have , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , that 's already now a few years ago , as this so just kind in the media was happening .
there was the train already has sailed , because <unk> changed the plants , that was suddenly , a danger .
genes that was the gas , with green , <unk> .
genes that were kind of what we first .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there 's all situations , where on the market farmers who actually become have : hey , i <unk> vegetables .
no idea what that to be on , yeah .
so , yes , okay , dutch tomatoes , we can fly over to discuss .
but to the time i was in in the lab , here 's active , working in the and was eventually , totally frustrated , because i 've tried to these evil genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came after home , and my back then my neighbor is : i 'd ask , you look so , but not 's happy , which is because we go ?
i like this : yeah , i try there 's been three days , so a little gene in my bacteria to transform and this works , it does n't .
so that was , what i 've tried , to to explain , so somehow an <unk> , gene , i thought , yes , it goes down the good old lady , when i of genes are talking to know they already , what you , says .
so that was , what i actually meant , so one particular sequence , i went there in this <unk> <unk> and when we wanted .
but it was the , what the woman who are perceived from .
this woman has i 'm never again , the hand , all shook up !
who knows , doing what i do you <unk> , <unk> ?
genes is what 's very , we first .
now that 's already well , ten years ago , and yet , which , that kind in consciousness ones are .
genes , that 's some kind of what we first .
<unk> i 've been quite a long did n't even more than read .
it 's come then always the gene and technology , free and it has but really in our language fact , there 's thought .
<unk> not allowed to europe , was a headline .
<unk> is different approach , you much of other , corn , the yes , it does not genes that contains .
another kind of headline writers , <unk> makes a rat used to die .
yes , that was also a beautiful headline .

anyway , whether the time , or the picture , all talk from <unk> .
fortunately , it 's still not <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid , that takes also not anymore , long .
but that shows how easy , which insecurity in the population this is now , because they range , just not with the issues <unk> .
nevertheless , we must be in our future us with such advanced technologies are less .
now was just <unk> , nobody had the big on the subject , but it be about things you voted , and the elected , what in the most really no idea of view .
and that 's pretty sad .
how come actually looking at all this information , from the lab in the population ?
if what we assume , this small , boy , this motivated , where are sitting in his lab , has a little experiment , <unk> say anything , beautiful and well , and he does is going to think , it turns person , this is , but the time , what that became interested , but in the public .
then we have to the first place , among the professor go .
the boss , the decide , then , okay , very cool topic , location of his name on as <unk> , that 's always important in science , <unk> be .
good idea , i am still not in public , it goes to a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> thinks , oh , that 's good idea , class , because we doing a press <unk> .
<unk> , because we have a press , with a project , a fabulous idea , and that 's coming then some way out of nowhere in ivory coast .
this is then <unk> , yes , but there to whom are really ?
now are these kinds of the institute 's rarely go by , usually have multiple <unk> so a common of the design , a shared <unk> .
and of all these will then the <unk> , the right cool projects , will then over the <unk> the day of magazines were given to with the editors , no matter whether it leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> are .
this is the way .
from the base is it away and filtered , in ivory up into the really , really cool experiments , then , that actually speak of projects , there in these <unk> arise .
that are , quality , being able magazine , that are really well done , there 's face of all it 's easy for free , yes , but who that i get i 've seen it ?
in this issue , just the , the road , for being interested .
in the <unk> we call that always the <unk> the <unk> .
so that , the , it’s already doing this has become interested , the <unk> then still the newspaper , yes , beautiful and good .
nice magazine , reached the very important to the ones , the road , for being interested , and that maybe about an idea have , where <unk> it continues to even in these articles .
who do <unk> ' i do with but really ?
the <unk> , the that it anyway , actually .

yet , again , our future will we just kind <unk> can , if we interact with these <unk> engage .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , <unk> , that are all these issues , the <unk> are , the gentleman <unk> but not really understand and and over the he kind of voting supposed to .
my project , my idea is therefore , unlike <unk> , these small , young , you get this scientist out of nowhere in ivory to take , really completely unheard of normal <unk> to separate , and him , there a course , to do , a seminar of how to science understandable to communicate .
what is that i mostly what happens , that a scientist , so i have a buddy , we 've known as we have been good about twenty years , he 's <unk> , it 's stick with us a <unk> rule , it not after his job to ask .
once he the mouth race does and over his career telling it , he told us <unk> .
<unk> , that are scientists , the tell you then a what of <unk> .
<unk> , it sounds like incarceration , <unk> , despite <unk> , <unk> is already nearly all that same level as the genes .
<unk> treated , that 's kind , oh , you do n't know , what this one is .
the the really teach them to pass time on , that 's beautiful and well , if you going on a conference , me and there than your people to build your <unk> , on <unk> anything you tell you want to them , you can you 'd like of <unk> tell , but glimpse still time , , tell , but we just water on this .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school , so , this is my idea , these young scientist , the still not so far in the hierarchy <unk> are , the still a little more malleable are , the school i think , `` you an act makes the .
that has for all of a use , <unk> , like anything that , and investors , the want to also know , which there in the <unk> happens .
eventually are the same time , tax , the that there are used , so that must naturally , actually also the <unk> communicate .
but the these training , that 's just a story .
i want you then also really ago , a jury , sit and the to raise your project to discuss their project a jury , very tough , , <unk> , honest , even worse is about ernst haeckel 's not : the kids .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if that is real , of albert einstein : if you do it 's not just explain that you can , then you touch it does n't really understood .
so , the scientists , from the lab to take and your project really to rethink , how can i think that really quite normal understandable to communicate ?
so storytelling , there 's has already a range .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , in her to each of the university , quite common , but there also that i get i in this issue , just again , the <unk> .
who , which goes , because , to <unk> end of the city in the university , looking for some sunday morning , connect with hormones , there a talk to <unk> different times . ab ?
these are the message that it anyway , actually .
because i 've got back to my <unk> .
so , are the people , the road , anyway , for being interested , that there , drive and wondering , there single to get to listen .
this is beautiful , there are going to any <unk> done , all these are satisfied , all these are happy , driving , looking at home and this is it .
and so you sit , i still on a second aspect , to say , it remains , not in this <unk> the seti project . .
this scientist will also still be trained , how are wired , actually children ?
because of really <unk> have , naturally , on the essential to reduce .
because scientists , like the research on , and how children , their world , exploring , is the same .
children are working very extremely scientifically .
they do anything you so we learn from the walk .
they try to what , it work ?

children learn from extremely scientifically .
that are really <unk> , <unk> lo and <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which factors i change has to realize that it works or not .
this is normal !
but that have many <unk> .
and of therefore i think , really can work that only , if after the <unk> of creation and those scientists had permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the kids of kindergarten , from the primary school , there in common experiments that make the children , on whose <unk> , and wondering , there really do it with , because i 'm convinced i 'm saying that the children and the scientists are actually in this issue is the same language to talk .
and then you can perhaps , maybe some point , that 's so my hope to tell the kids that then also at home , and then that i get i also , mr. <unk> , the road , then also , suddenly , for the major issues are interested , because the children with him that tell .
this is then not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere in case , galileo , but his children to tell him , something that it <unk> mirror , with a <unk> worked has shown that 's now , but a bread <unk> has shown that 's there paper is lit that has , and understand , then also , and shaking , then you may also the head , as a danish architect , so a house can build .
and not only that i get i then of course , mr. <unk> , but also the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .

a scientist has to yes , not can communicate .
yes , i think about me then , okay , then she calls i live to court .
but who somehow , in a department at work anymore , <unk> is in a company , like anything that , there 's why in the next is go .
thank you .
i a crazy , is the question .
and fly you can also not every day .
the last few weeks ago were terrible .
the weather us has a big at the bottom , through the calculation , done .
ago , seven , soon after eight years , i 'm been asked , if i 'm here that are taking want .
i was before the ceo , almost 10 years , it at the <unk> <unk> in munich , and in <unk> .
we 're there are quite far ahead to go up to come .
they had <unk> as a client .
and for me was that actually rather , yeah , that 's now , but <unk> .
what is this really ?
<unk> , that 's actually a ridiculous .
i quit but then they got to know who 's behind this jar and it 's why i stand here today .
and yes , maybe it 's a little crazy , but it is , so this , too high , emotionally .
it 's beautiful and always exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'm going to you just in the next <unk> , eighteen minutes , a bit of this life expectancy of <unk> tell .
i 'm the ceo in <unk> .
the company , there 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the ceo of the <unk> .
this company , there 's been twenty years .
and the ceo of the <unk> .
the company , there 's been about <unk> or eighteen years .
that runs the <unk> here at the <unk> .
<unk> .

there 's that are the world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and it , we 're actually just by then still 10 to action .
this is also have already what .
there 's around after two thousand active global <unk> .
so that 's actually not like a market .
that 's also not time a niche interest .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also : why do you do that then actually ?
how does it all ?
<unk> in insisted and only 10 to action , because we can see , which still not even talk about why this is .
very quickly led to the story .
<unk> has a lot of you so crazy <unk> <unk> the back here 's data set up .
very short <unk> .
has allowed to <unk> fourteen years ago , at the first world war around eighteen <unk> to sleep in '' .
then they were in the first world war , <unk> <unk> died in the way <unk> and <unk> , been around <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
the have then in london , of the federal and so forth and so the job .
and when we <unk> and eight , sort of london was here are , and with a big <unk> there a <unk> campaign to fly , were the english newspapers <unk> filled with the headline : this time you come , but not with smart bombs , but in a peaceful in itself .
so that , has the story because we went in <unk> .
and we had an insane campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was not so very pleased to because he would suddenly realized that 's become vulnerable to because it , a scoop was indeed , which the old memory in there 'd put them .

but yet it was in london a good ad campaign , except the weather in north end up there was many years ago , already very bad and very moving sideways .
and we 're not very much for flying .
then has <unk> two decades , <unk> <unk> hugo <unk> has that 's taken .
and has a <unk> for maybe , that then to america and delivered the house .
that has a myth game play , that all the german nation of people just naturally , again something felt that has , as , which is <unk> and <unk> that airship kidnapped was .
there was the then in in new york , receiving end with a pin .
and all the german nation 's got up has <unk> , we 're back , who .

but actually are then returned to <unk> and <unk> just five , six , seven <unk> at all still were built and really only two really big , the <unk> <unk> and the hindenburg , the passengers carries on this .
passengers , a hundred , where around <unk> passengers , and <unk> were it in the end <unk> <unk> .
it was , but a myth .
and the <unk> then at that was the first broadcast live , these are the crash with there 's also , unfortunately , yes <unk> .
next to the titanic that event that time , where a an icon , a a product <unk> is , and then also never more and then in flight .
also the other devices have been in the position .
and <unk> , <unk> the last day of the existing <unk> destroyed .
the the the materials used for <unk> , <unk> , the halls mined land .
then i was a long did n't move around their sixties years .
and then the had the <unk> zf <unk> and <unk> , the that had the idea , maybe we should it that back to start .
and i was hired <unk> , because you that is , technically a brilliant product has evolved , we come back to you get here , but the market .
yes , he 's all was a market ?
what is there 's actually go ?
so .
talk about that we now .
the <unk> <unk> , that may still a moment to explain to , we ham , yes , through time goes , it 's still , <unk> , people who has a lot of people did .
there 's many companies that go out of this corporation of about this is .
it are today <unk> staff , around the two decades , billions of revenue .

there is written a lot behind .
the 've got me then as well convinced , here from , to come .
the <unk> there is , is really a very regular plane as each other infinite plane as well , but has , sorry , has <unk> a gas , the helium 's not hydrogen , and <unk> also a <unk> with <unk> .
it 's like a whale , the in the water on and under the denser , and there the <unk> do have to .
the time now is not there , that in the details to understand .
inside it looks a <unk> so from , with a structure .
there 's two types of <unk> .
there 's rigid <unk> , that we are , <unk> in the the case , and <unk> .
the have drawn inward , no structure and that are sort of the like these balloons up in <unk> .
these are the most <unk> , the in the world was built these are , around the four or , a kilometer piece .
and of that there 's only today , as i said earlier , only still <unk> in was of minus to our own insisted , so around the only still two decades .
looks like then the production of the same is a shell where one is .
the left the structure of time now .
and the shell is also <unk> .
it comes from the <unk> .
source : the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> back then there are the origins .
it costs , one , the decimal point two million dollars , so a shell .
and it 's got to <unk> be , have to <unk> be and must also <unk> be , because again and you have to yes , at mit , that when times a crack in it would or a hole , that 's not on to tear it can .
there are doing the <unk> again <unk> do and check out exactly , whether they 're going on the holes in control .

the <unk> is so technically a <unk> product .
and that you see here 's down the side of numbers , very short time .
one the decimal point where nine percent , one the decimal point where nine percent , one the decimal point , six four percent <unk> , that means of thousand a thousand flights in the year , about falling , maybe <unk> from .
this is very very little and very very well .
this is a <unk> .
the can . they can see the poles .
but there 's a other trend , the us right now to have the power and the have i ended up here 's mapped .
we had three years ago <unk> percent <unk> , when i started , to have ago ago <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may we were born in their sixties percent .
if you the eight years , my eight years , surely <unk> <unk> and <unk> to it , something that wants , then you can say at least in these eight years , obviously a <unk> the <unk> , also clear , in these eight years , which , the weather clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can because the passengers were also not by the fog and fly .
the want , yes , that you see .
and the the <unk> or <unk> up , and actually every year , has been to time .
so a little picture of our of the fact , that our weather , it’s not just felt , goods , but as well statistically , because we do the weather , every day , to change .
but because that 's so , this is now that well , has the e.u. , a program <unk> <unk> to do , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're a essential part of this program .
i come today , tomorrow 's just come from finland .
that airship on this is here is equipped to is a flying lab to become .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between the earth and <unk> feet .
that means <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> t 's flying from italy , until you get up after finland in a <unk> <unk> .
over many many hundreds <unk> measuring the and analyzed the air out how the road , <unk> , how they react to on our of things that we the bottom , do .
there , so i 've just explain , up there are we just do with the airship on .
a great a really wonderful assignment .
and it 's when you so i want concrete derived from the the subject of weather .
that happens is so very well .
and here are still alive once a few <unk> .
that airship on top of sweden , the last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is the way , the weather super , <unk> , <unk> degrees , only 30 degrees .
the <unk> say something like this did they still never .
i quit while i 've got there just wonderful , beautiful and warm days experienced .
the mosquitos who were then also do n't , so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have for de <unk> as <unk> diamond , `` for , better said volcanoes , looking for , the underground worlds are , the their wake are by the erosion , through a million years .

because i 've gone time ever wondered , well , what do we there really ?
and what to support we there really ?
the end , we were after two years , then also done .
the <unk> went and then also not on .
the entire <unk> came back then <unk> and the project was then finish .
and a tornado , has the <unk> at the mast , then , then , like that damaged , that he also the same way down to stay could .
i was , but not so bad .
we had there , very good insurance , and they were actually very happy .
that was , which is the prototype .
and i knew did n't realize what i do with what should .
yes , what we now do , a very quick <unk> from the from the studied there .
what we now do , it 's about it is the men 's the page , it goes to its complexity , it goes off to ask , growth or she insisted .
what we now do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do to service of course .
we we need to the <unk> always get .
<unk> called an aging .
there are yes , and you are also see are inside , after 10 to fifteen is already again , the be replaced have to .
we replace just the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about that we still .
we do we need to the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're a general aviation <unk> <unk> , the of the germans <unk> and of the european watch , by computers will , every time to and all the time , with <unk> how <unk> also , or how we also an airbus .
that 's also <unk> and costs money and to be taken away and also get worse .
the question is , makes you actually on ?
i want you on going to evolve ?
you make greater <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , unmanned <unk> .
what do you there really ?
this is about you keep in the market ?
this is about you keep in the <unk> ?
and that we have any of course , in my time also try on .
and there , we 've also some <unk> suffered .
how to actually also the <unk> <unk> some <unk> sustained has and several times a bust was .
the beginning , on the billboard stood still the donation of <unk> .
the population of the german population has led him at that saved with six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship crashes were and he in basically a bust was , has the population him a donation done .

we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco , with a customer .
behind it would put a very <unk> <unk> .
both of projects are , unfortunately , and failed .
so we also <unk> .
simultaneously , we have <unk> won .
because i did n't a picture that says , because we that <unk> <unk> still not show you can .
but just in america is now the <unk> years of the first <unk> in the cold , ready to be .
we have three piece on sale .
with <unk> to do what we like a with a partner that , the technology , new .
and that 's a great success , but at the defeat to leave you .
two customers are in basically <unk> been , because it 's not went .
why it was not ?
we know it actually already .
either was the location , not the right or the passengers had to go far <unk> or in america who knows who did you <unk> the last 30 forty years , the advertising did .
the ham , people have <unk> , have the airship seen , have said : i 'd ask , again a , again a <unk> , the power of advertising .
there can the knew did n't like , that you go there <unk> can .
and it was quite a double the hard in marketing foods that might get to earth : hey , people will call the end , flying .
<unk> going , well .
the pilots to transport of the year , transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we 've just <unk> managed , because of weather .
there 's missing , then the same , once a half million .
this is then bad .
the <unk> flies <unk> cars are here .
it 's the sense , the course is beautiful , when i also when ceos , then i see how the passengers get out and and and all laughing and we in basically also not advertising do , because it 's mouth to speak up goes and again and we about <unk> sold <unk> have , and people say , that 's so beautiful , and i recommend it your friends , known and whom we also , and up , in the family .
and we are great <unk> .
which that i again and clean up to come up with the mistake , that what you think we are -- she .
you could still more flights to do .
we have so a <unk> at the <unk> and we are out -- she .
so that is actually also not very much .
we do also an advertising .
that 's time a project where they had been studying the audi sponsored by .
and an audi has that made here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and you must naturally , sometimes that , the <unk> imagine : power of advertising has always make sense ?
we have yes , really enough ads , but the internet has much change , the <unk> about the launch to myself , because the <unk> all of control .
the <unk> is largely <unk> , 's why you today industry is still 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one packed , that <unk> , three has <unk> bought , 10 are actively .
so are then six of 10 .
that means that we 'll then the market , actually , if it at all of a is to control .
and hope , that , and also again a future , something that code .
and what the opening up by david , scott , commander of the apollo six , after his <unk> paris <unk> and five , he has said : just at [ the world champion eyes on the stuff <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> 's beautiful .
advertising do we also find you .
just find we had any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , has a technological value .
because we have any customers .
that 's not , has been .
it 's <unk> , goes on and go down .
so a so a bid takes years until you the but what you .
and then there 's then again years , no .
think there 's also very strange effect , the easy for and hard to control are .
anyway , is that the situation , <unk> , a point in the global market , so actually not a market .
yet we do it on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power of it to do .
they ask , it’s just taking the question : in what form we make it on ?
how much money we give in the global market ?
what do what we do it for here ?
in what form is it ? so what they 're right ?
and i personally , they 've got me also asked , something very personal to say , i 'm obviously this next to my prehistory <unk> , where where i <unk> <unk> wanted , then , against the big , drag , also <unk> has this little <unk> dead , moving to want to talk about how it also here comes to rescue .

and then , there 's a <unk> about greenpeace , the in the money , choked are and not even know what they do with what should and almost took it to basically went from .
because they have me to employ to pick the very to <unk> .
and i for three years greenpeace was led me as <unk> and now i am that here in the hope , a long future in <unk> to achieve .
zero , this true ? house for seconds , i 'm not yet done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .
that are my three penalty points , i went in the eighteen minutes to discuss want .
why we are today in from mountains , or are plenty of ?
how we come to transform their livelihood ?
and do so , what to do ?
what it what 's hear that there was really ?
we begin with our first point .
the first part is perhaps once in a depressing .
but it 's also about you , right , the challenges to show .
i 'm in a few years , if only ' that still more difficult to have been that looks like , you to understand .
that we have a problem have today , you know that every child .
that we environmental security .

all kinds of <unk> are exponentially growing up there .
if you put it 's time in a historical long view , you see , the as oil , for example , then they do that a very short episode in the story has been to be .
the moment we can be not imagine that 's kind of different goes , when that as oil and around on to go up .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , it used to be there 's time the columbian mammoth , we can look at the last <unk> years , together .
that you can also <unk> at , <unk> ' i also , right .
you can also say , who needs because the glacier ?
you can also say , the ocean is far away .
but it goes , then we already , if you , it’s a little bit more specifically , so busy to stand like , you really at the challenges , the pieces of things that 's really to avoid is true , otherwise we 've just trouble is what the <unk> , it at the health .
<unk> it says , because those days -- over 100 degrees .
and there 's hear degrees ' in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> like , you always more and further , so to be bad .
it goes , but also , around the <unk> , mostly in asia .
you think that sort of the himalayas , where the big streams <unk> and the <unk> of them to depend that there works with water from the himalayas is coming .
it 's about the end , not wanting to the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , what we do , because there 's already too much larger , crisis .
and <unk> , but it goes to prevent us to take the people , the like , you in in a radically altered our ecosystems , very much on space will live .
it goes to present , is an biodiversity .
the deserts , spreading fell .
the fresh water is less and .
this is the aral sea , where a essential part of our cotton , from .
and all this , where that come from ?
this whole bad things , , tell ' present , hanging in the a or another form with the global <unk> together .
with the , what we have total of the ground , get , what we harvest .
not just a , the oil and the metals and the minerals , but also the power to resources are is , to renewable , but in the end scarce .
and we should just look out that we so little as possible of them to use , which to also the end , less than waste and the emissions to produce .
so it goes around it , that 's in the introduction was already told you have been the entire <unk> really dramatically to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just a c , o , two , <unk> of a car on a different , but really differently to live .
another way to economies .
our technology , completely new , to change .
if we still time a quick look back the hunters and moving forward , and there 's still on the earth societies , the essentially , so life , come with a ton of resources in the year per person and year from .
in a <unk> were it ended up in the longest time the human history to three or five pounds .
today are it fifteen until <unk> .
so <unk> which , this <unk> .
and he 's very , learned was distributed on the earth .
it 's in north still more than with us in us to be more than for the earth , portable , is .
and in other parts of the world , look at on africa , very , much less .
and that energy coming , we craters , the impact on with us , the rivers , the air is much better to become in the last decades , but it is in basically bring it out that we that in other parts of the world , representing this year .
and the other parts of the world , let , i knew that , but less and like it .
and therefore , who are also the conflict , that we see , of <unk> , is that they , afghanistan , enable you look carefully , let them in the <unk> years of the american geological survey , and then you see , where the resources to come up .
and that 's because it 's there have very colorful , which means , there 's many resources , there , where the <unk> the world are .
so if we do with clean up want , then we need to us with the subject <unk> .
so we need to us to change , the ecological limits what are everywhere , the <unk> is everywhere .
and that , what we here , among <unk> lives have is so not <unk> .
that has been in the mahatma gandhi , were as he has said , the world has enough for being the needs , but not for everybody 's greed .
and there are we , just as we here in the average life ever been a far over it .
so .
that was the like , you <unk> part .
but i must always suggesting that you the needs to stand to understand it 's worth , too , what to change .
also if i see , which would say , it 's worth , too much as so , another way to live , which is more their livelihood .
but it 's still , and around like , you , from the <unk> <unk> you need help but a rationale , , tell ' i time .
so , which is actually their livelihood ?
and there must we 'll find out that we in our rich share the world that so much 've reached economically , socially , seen quality , at the standard of yet us in the average , often do n't comfortable .
here 's a pretty good mood , but there 's people , and you know certain things as humans , that 's not that good can deal with this story .
i did the time i wrote that there .
<unk> and climate have the same cause .
we 're working to a lot and to be intensely .
this is on the one side and we get yourself in the stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'm also very happy to .
and on the other two cause we just looked at these <unk> .
what but then is a good life ?
how we can this is defined ?
now comes like , you a a little piece of scientific break .
this is also , what i did before i said , to have and what i see , which say , i 'm 's scientific , like , you grounded planes , but here is it 's hear me just drum , how can i think that 's like , you , first time is defined ?
and there 's important , to understand better life has always two aspects .
better life has the aspect of the objective conditions as it me goes , what i 'm going to eat , to have .
i figured a roof over the the head ?
i figured friends ?
i figured relationship , i can actually the life to participate ?
but let me just as well , which is how it to me , so , how to go , ' i myself with it comes to ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived quality .
and then <unk> ' i two words on bring down , the edges of the spot are important .
this one 's needs .
the needs are the very fundamental dimension of our human development , our lives there 's hear you , right to evaluate their feelings .
if we our needs satisfy everyone can , then we 're happy .
and needs , you ca n't say , needs are sustainable , or not sustainable .
the needs by definition se lead still not to the <unk> .
what are the needs ?
you can be different place in a quote , i picked up here 's only two called .
and there you course , the physical needs , but also need for safety , after the social relations .
after the protection , after the participation , after <unk> , after the creativity , after the spirituality , after the freedom .
all this has a bit of what with money to do .
but to a large part of men 's not actually , but the question is , how can i told me that in my life to set up .
and there i of what the second important term .
the strategy .
the strategy , that i 'm using the me available to what about wanting to me this needs to meet .
and there 's hear , then we 've been a drum , that can i like , you with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
because i can not much money to hire or a little money you need .
strategies that are just looked at my behavior as i told me my needs <unk> .
that has with my values related to , with the resources , with the possibilities , that i .
if i little money , to have 'll figure ' i different from my needs to try , to satisfy as if i like , you much money on the bank account of have .
it 's about the first of the radiation <unk> , this is the roof over the the head , to eat , and then , so to the radiation <unk> .
and here 's hear , then you , right , that can with a lot sooner or a little <unk> , that can , so to sustainable , or <unk> be .
and if we the whole of strategies that 's made me to the are available to pursue my needs to satisfy to summarize , then we talk from a lifestyle .
so .
that was the , so to scientific break .
and now it 's hear you , right now what we can do now ?
how it 's hear how does it ?
and there to just a couple of evidence .
obviously has to the like , you also every day for politics . '' which i find .
but the evidence on the individual way on a technological way , here is , , get ' i , a lot also about technology has talked to have been and finally , also on a political leaders that .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what do we ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides , the verge have like , you said , the risk of this is that we like , you know , in more and with a lot more and resources that use .
the end , the quality , again , there’s just because it also the effects are always gets you will , as it , and on us the end , back into computers will be .
or , whether we do it to create , as it 's there in a different direction , go , the with less <unk> , may also with less than consumption , but with a higher quality that way to them .
there 's real one of my <unk> , maybe you know him some , <unk> of <unk> the this topic <unk> , so more lives of with less <unk> .
there 's hear much to present technology as i can each one thing , that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee , the car , the traffic , how can i felt that produce ?
cement , i can now different to produce , i can make the house of wood to build , were kind etc. .
the issue with a much less <unk> more or the same quality to create .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> has this what to put it , the <unk> per <unk> , and because we 're at the the , what 's also now been in time i discussed have been is , there 's hear very deep sense that on a 's companies to look .
where are actually the needs ?
what kind of services , i can really satisfy us ?
and how can i think that with stories as little <unk> do ?
and , they do n't do with a little bit less , but with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there 's the many examples of the hackers like , you already can .
in vienna supposed to a seven-story building be built with two decades , are allowed .
with seven are allowed it 's in <unk> already built .
that basically , in from wood of sand .
that you , if you maybe it in fifty years , not more need to dissect it was , and then again in his bits and not like , you , so we 'd like , you very much less resources out it with all other people together , you go from there , so to the moment with the half and the goal is with a fifth of making <unk> , over the whole lifetime of what the house ever thought , with this one fifth of making <unk> long run out .
it goes , but also , so much in our own , as it , like <unk> ' time i was really ?

where he shows , how hard it in the end is like , you really from the from the like , you from this treadmill come out .
the <unk> , i want to me , so to go over the others come after , and then i 'm like , you forever , in this in this race in there .
you yourself , has like , you 're seeing the message that i figured quickly <unk> , and then , `` get ' i was the new .
at the nicest <unk> ' i the <unk> , that you know of all .



and i can be very much more afford .
this is productivity , that 's growth , we get that in a back .
but do . i do n't really time has saved .
i picked for me and offers a failure is done .
there 's but good examples , slow food into the example , where i really , so to the claim the quality and the claim that means that the <unk> in the foreground , in place .
and with a low <unk> more quality to do one .
one of my <unk> is <unk> .
there 's a best-selling , today , you has it so that using ai average person we had in germany , in austria , about 10 thousand things in a household by .
they can time to start to count .
who ago , two , three generations of 10 thousand things had , was having employees , pick them .
the have us that managed dissent .
we need to myself , so we have to deal .
and less and people come with it clear , with those entire career options .
and we need a raising , the us have , and helps to the us have , and <unk> with these few things that the interest .
if only ' , get ' i really interesting , perhaps is also like , it ai for conservation , from the spaceship , there 's go , it turns , get ' i , also not 10 thousand from things .
the next example is use instead of having .
a true boom .
the star , <unk> , <unk> which , like , you might ago -- twenty years of , in in alternative circles , that 's been .
in the meantime , use it always more people , if we use , <unk> thinking .
if we use , <unk> thinking .
platforms , and business that just as to work , where do you the things , which we already have these beautiful <unk> here , the front of a few hundred years was built still , so to use and still about the whole other centuries , to use it 's what they in the end .
that , what even invested was just better to use .
this is the end , also a question of justice .
do . i showed you before , so to how profoundly unequal , that 's take you that as a picture , between africa and europe and a a <unk> world .
like , you so , that all the sex with these resources of living there can 's only then as possible , if we really can use less .
and that means that i just not less quality , because of us -- as it has already like , you to have that much .
but it 's an important task of the economy , the company , these products , those services , actually available to imagine that we need anything to us a good life to create with a much less resources .
at the last component of , that has also something with the large scale on to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i was the time .
if you a little attention to the the quest to read , then it 's been on back from below oecd , <unk> , now that <unk> every week to get these the quest again , looking down <unk> .
it means , yes , a crisis , she 's in the door closed for my view , and also , after the , what we like , you very much with the economists , we 've talked and so that too , have , here are the numbers for austria , you find that , as it for all countries growth is going , just looking downward .
and there 's no reason , again , growth to have , so , like how i know that from my youth , from the <unk> years , i think we know .
so , for part has that brought in math reasoning . one .
one point five percent growth is today , so much like eight percent growth ago , and fifty years .
and that eight percent is that , what china today has .
that are also about there , where we may ago , and fifty years were .
in general , if the pie bigger is , of course , harder still time , eight percent complained .
this one percent is still a lot , so that we will be good living there .
but you must naturally , like , you click on it 's done , that is , no , even if we are zero percent growth would have , that i would that yes , the next year , just as much of producing and consume and incomes to have like in this year .
that we can be good to invest and so we can work .
that 's also why there 's not that all backwards , because you these statistics of us know , the show that growth models is already too long , ' not more with the quality of them together .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in in <unk> countries , about the bottom of it said , like an we are .
and actually also jobs are also , without growth as possible and that depends 's not that deeply connected together , like this tells us again and of <unk> and how they all the hot suggests is .
so that is simply not and then you must have found , time with the economics <unk> .
and it comes and around and increasingly , it that i found , <unk> how to a more or next week , , get ' i , in coming in the trend , a larger story with this subject to begin to grapple with .

's what they the end , and not to try not primarily to see the returns to create , not primarily to cut growth to create what for our countries do n't even more about .
for the peru , and find these countries , indeed , china , for india there 's the ai very different kind of a story .
and that will be wondering , only then you out also under <unk> , if we there , like , you still growing , let and we just like , you on this level , on this high level , like an we 're good on to live and economies .
that energy needs a 's also , politics .
it takes your goals .
it takes some indicators , say the economists .
it takes not just like , you that growth , but we should actually look and measure and ask , how about ernst haeckel 's actually with the quality , so is the to ?
is that was down ?
so then also our politicians to measure .
of course , as high , is the <unk> ?
how does it , so to put together ?
we need a essentially one aspect of who is , the <unk> finally to tax avoidance and not the work .
who of these are particularly the entrepreneurs under them , but also the employees , you know that very well .
what , so to respond to control walk away , we know in the first time a colleague , paid by .
that you could very different do .
the resources are mine , so to cut down and therefore , among the resources in taxes , and not the work .
and you have to the end , all <unk> <unk> them to get employment to create a space to <unk> to save them , health , infrastructure , without growth .
that goes , but there you have to form , like , you a little too hard .
that go conclusion , more or less , on all levels can in this direction , ever be , we can be too hard , we can as businesses , the right products , services than consumers , so to ask us , what we need some really , how we do this what 's like , you good for us ?
what we need them and what we need them might not ?
the right , politics and vote , the framework for a hard .
a couple of evidence till i was given .
and in the end of course also the science <unk> percent of all <unk> ? is still in the direction , how we in the growth speed up ?
i realized , but unfortunately , nobody ever done .
if you that the quest look if you the development and look at the the last two years , it goes always been , down because it 's not about .
the politics can do it 's not and the <unk> will not growth to create , but this is the question how we go with the time of the world , which case that we have a good life of them have ?



thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this town .
this city has been so many stories to tell .
one of , which , i 'm in a few hundred years happened , .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving i take the same , and on the story is a bit later .
they 're going to do have with the fortress <unk> .
this is an ai <unk> , the here in the middle of this town it says , and so much of this city 's also believe is , and and does .
one another story before .
it was clinging to a hot summer in <unk> , nevada .
a man , you realize , how suddenly , in his shoes , so , right that it right <unk> .
that him to 's warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he does then turned out of a he pulls the shoe of take a knife <unk> also not long spike in play world , which several times makes them there are lots of holes in play .
he pulls the shoe , again , among us is to be a knife to be , and you realize he has a new climate in shoe .
it 's the shoe , the breathing , born .
and this number , that you see here is the show in the <unk> the billionaires , among the mario <unk> is today .
a company is <unk> of about , with four letters .
the a or another kind of them knows it .
he has the original idea , even nike and adidas offered .
both have been rejected .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do what my own company .
<unk> goes , he appeal to the stock market .
too , now several thousand employees in the scarce , three hundred of businesses in about <unk> countries in the world .
so much to the subject of creative problem-solving .
why not something new to invent stuff that still not there is ?

if you <unk> still do n't know , it is for these things that is that an opportunity ?
this question that has to me already too often helped , in a tough .
if something has gone wrong is , or my collaborator <unk> me or a technology does n't work or what do anything that .
<unk> , little memory , <unk> .
these things that is that an opportunity ?
and already you get from <unk> into the <unk> .
what that will do you can <unk> ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and a different example has been talking about the <unk> <unk> days of the world , which the <unk> of total of <unk> .
and the core evidence , like creative people can be , if it comes to their own insurance about .
i want you a few examples here show .
that are so in fact that , which was the children at the <unk> <unk> and that has to it also a ad was done .
i <unk> ' the awesome .
my son has the woman does n't <unk> .

or i had the whole day , plants <unk> when i way , the achieved , grew up a sudden , the bush in my <unk> and i could the other car will not see more .
that very , who 's guilt is , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> been , and two times , almost died .
because they can see me , but at least that half <unk> in on .
the last thing i was clinging to the the crash was n't blame .
blame was the young woman in <unk> .
if you a man who are there is that each one another explanation obsolete .
if you , but a woman who are , you know about it anyway , not .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish , and i dream of them , that we all the more of this creativity to use .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that does n't have to be like this .
why not things just time i do differently ?
old one of things that we do , the code routine become are , the us may have ever get bored , or <unk> , as opposite .
why the not just time i do differently , that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there 's real so <unk> company , the use this .
for instance , <unk> , the have yet these <unk> of their music powered by standing , these signs , or her to the wall , for example , and there it then maybe so what on it .
also a way , right ?
time the coffee order to stay instead , to <unk> .
or so what .
we have n't put wifi , <unk> to you .
is yes , already today <unk> , right ?
if you the phone , not anything you type can .
or food they arrive at me , otherwise , starvation , we both .
rude , but creative .
so we need something 's .
i if only ' one of the client or an environment that then go in and would and say , okay , that they like me .
that <unk> ' i like .
a german <unk> has in the <unk> the current day 's <unk> world , which in <unk> .
once the sport , once the current economic news , once upon politics .

even got the the complaint about to long <unk> the can eat .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant , very small , so i had the chefs take all shook hands of up to do .
it was to look closely .
the 've ever thought , together , what do we ?
how to solve , we the problem ?
we ca n't pick up to be in the kitchen .
he had this is an idea of about .
on every table is a interrupted <unk> <unk> set fresh <unk> salt , pepper , and a <unk> .
so , that naturally , the an environment in the of waiting on it 's to eat their <unk> already well , let myself <unk> could .
just time different .
a creative idea , and may also with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person the power . they can currently not just a popular .
you that person is the leader in the <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and currently <unk> yes , the german , in orbit .
already the second day , that takes it , a monday , so four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> to the staff of making a month , who wants , and you know you may already , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you here .
the people come to us what does is <unk> .
the bus who are full , it will <unk> run , people to organize the road , in the carpool , because each of course , after another , because of looking for , of a , after a b to come .
but why not time i also now approaching a little use and creatively , from his disadvantage do something ?
sometimes it happens : yeah , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> maybe it turns out , how wrong with this company , that , you might .
so we have yes , we have known that it is where it at the <unk> n't really goes well , but that they arrive at the <unk> also been to save you need to this is , but something to worry .
or the can <unk> in the car .
there , we know , yes , the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why , it’s not a piece of ourselves from the car , attached to having <unk> is do ?
or somebody in <unk> there 's and also have no way , the creative to create .
and all that has to do just with humor , with joy , with sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son working at me the office .
and sitting on this <unk> behind me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the process . <unk> .
and then it turns out he of links to right it , he has come , and i held in stinking <unk> , tell ' to the the you think , listen , on , this is yes , not a playground here .
he said to me , you look at me to take a big eyes , but there , the playground .
and in the moment <unk> ' i i 'm actually did he 's right , right ?
why is that 's not a playground today ?
why is that , what we do , not the playground for adults ?
that if only ' but very much more sense , right ?
if we are relaxed are , if we our talents to use to do that , what we like to do .
and order to excellence would get , but we create a relaxed way .
that appear to is that , if a lot of particular day , the week , coming then it changes , i knew what in our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow it 's our focus on a other day .
so a other day we 've been mostly , better .
so me into the weekend .
this sounds you yes , also have already in the media .
there on thursday 's said yes , already , only still a day here to the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time of the year , announced going to the vacation .
what are then the rest <unk> weeks of the year ?
it 's so awful ?
we 've all so awful , jobs ?
a <unk> it had a time on the front given to this topic .
yes , monday , `` you can ' i and the rest of life , you please ask yourself .
or on <unk> , on facebook , anywhere in social networks is this topic picked up .
once was walking , i go through the <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's and lots of business and i look to me that would like to time .
what have the so in the <unk> , what is it 's there are so ?
and one day <unk> i 'm in this business with these may tell you go to buy .
and the first sign , that you see here , yes , that is yes , actually very nice .
so , of with so i love to do instead to work .
i <unk> that yes , as well , i 'm a father of five kids , but i 'm also my work in now .
yes .
or a quiet <unk> for women <unk> is that <unk> sign .
why that , your mindset , the road , there degrees , becomes world , which increasingly , and always whistling .
somebody has been there times as an answer on this direction , posted it 's not the monday , it are mine jobs .
and i ask even in fact , with the pink , glasses , here forward to come and say , okay , make ' time a shift .
what we thought of my job is beautiful ?
this silly , is , even when hal 's the pink , glasses , is , it looks like everything in a bit of like before .
so something beautiful to talk , n't that is beautiful , in it 's obviously not .
the pink , glasses , is the way that 's good to the bicycle , drive .
there holding them a wonderful , the fly . ab : that is what else in the eye of land it would .
but to <unk> <unk> they do n't .
where is us that , if we do n't that change ?
actually the job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside , when <unk> .
it ends , maybe in a system where we so similar to us feel like the mouse .
the mouse up by a in this cycle , and running , and running , and running , and eventually is a 's going to quickly , this cycle , it hits the poor mouse and they will tip over out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know them , yes , nothing else , she goes back in play in the <unk> .
and again , and again and perhaps the movie , every day <unk> that <unk> know you might even after all of making them , yes , soft .
this is beautiful <unk> here with hay , so they do , naturally , yes , there a failure and it goes and over again , so it there .
and that , what we as funny and feel , probably has the mouse , eventually , concussion , yeah ?
or anything you need a 's , that <unk> <unk> .
you know i went and so , many years ago , so when i our way was from a seminar that for home .
and suddenly , where i was wondering , so the street under me , felt it was very , black ago , my eyes and somehow got to ' i stop .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i told me thought , which is there on ?

but how to look , and so , with the <unk> from ?
and i looked in my calendar , which to the to check , and saw , i worked for three weeks , through and somehow bugging me also the job .
after twenty years in the <unk> and collaborator , the first , i in the early already been wondering whether we 've been at night , i used to end you can do .
i figured also thought , what is it really what else is still for jobs ?

<unk> ' , whether a 's not sure ai other <unk> there in my job , 's a new spark off .
. i 've begun to the talks about doing large groups , the make me , right joy .
i do what ' , looking like a benign advice and <unk> and also other things , but this to get to pulses give lucky to , about what 's seeing that were prepared for me , right joy .
and this was n't always like this .
i quit her own see that we need to that this <unk> stress sick of power .
and sometimes need a 's right across this shot in front of the <unk> so , <unk> of me that 's degree , again , from the hospital , putting them had been , after he 's a heart work a chance , and suddenly , he starts , too , <unk> .
sooner than i said , you 're getting with some jogging it , he i 've always <unk> , yes , you with what your running and so .
today goes , he told myself .
so , so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in the right <unk> , but over time , we also , together , jogging , go .
what happened ?
in the bottom line , we will all the healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve , the material is , is the diseases now because of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the shrink the last 10 years , <unk> almost minus fifty percent , that 's beautiful , this is less .
of the rise of the psychiatric disorders , plus & percent .
this is something , where i told me think , to get that be like this ?
why is n't that ?
is the only in austria , so ?
no , also in germany , it 's so .
<unk> , <unk> , that will all healthier .
that 's so here on the left side to see it .
very bottom of psychiatric disorders of being a plus a hundred percent in the last 10 years , finds a a big german <unk> out .
the number of <unk> drugs are we know , to .
also the cost .
and it 's think , they 've all kinds of official , what we can do with this subject ?
do to stop the suggestions , sometimes come up and also it into an involuntary <unk> , like for example here .
so this is good meant .
and somebody has once said , no alcohol , is also not a solution .
but what is then the solution ?
what is then that , which gives us , but once again , healthy power and do it , and with joy is a way ?
and that has made me the last years busy .
. i 've ever thought , there 's it is something like <unk> , it and it 's and that was going to even though there ?
i 'm figure this , the job is not that , which gives us <unk> do it , and happy to make me to do .
there 's many other things , which are important , family , health , think , and so forth .
but in fact is yet , that we can to the biggest part of our <unk> in the work to spend .
and if we do that , why then not this what do that it is us pleasure preparing for and also by anything else .
the <unk> <unk> ' i do you <unk> ' as the last day of the offer that way to <unk> , and to <unk> on this .
these little had no idea that do you 're wondering , hopefully then it easier to realize it .
<unk> is for a talent and to do , liberty and environment .
that is , like <unk> ' i mean , talents ?
in which one environment , but do ' i think that , also with whom ?

because it 's the degree of the <unk> , the us <unk> .

and what do what i turn it ?
the manifestation .
for that are faced with these four areas .
and it can everyone for politics . '' which i check .
i had this to me to myself doing with your front of a few years , and i 'll do this is constantly and around .
can i mean , talents to use them ?
in which one environment ?
and that is , sometimes you go , i in a coffee shop with my laptop to pick the seminar prepare , or a <unk> .
freedom .
what kind of freedom , can i take to find that to do , what i 'd expect it .
and do i do a 's also ?
the manifestation .
the last ted u .
and then there 's and again and people , made me to explain why do n't that goes .
and why this at them much harder is .
then i figured , most of the very happy to an answer this point , in place .
who wants to find ways .
who 's not , has the reasons .

and they will be in two quite clearly .
what do we so with our talents ?
each of you has his great <unk> walking around .
that is yes , much to small .
that 's filled with a talent , with the gold , with it , all , with their skills .
what do we turn it ?
by the time to emerge by the end we ask this .
or if we in the hospital , who are or the end of a life .
what i figured out with my talent done ?
the way , who 's us feel like it has on <unk> <unk> , can look like to see , which still is to access .
so , what do we do with our talents , is so my first question , ends , i find ourselves world , which every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was , but we still something with a story .
that i wanted to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i 'm able to the spot , still do .
this fortress which was the rescue committee for the <unk> ago when shrink a kilometer of years , the enemies came .
and the enemies , we realized that these fortress so well , built was , that you do n't you take them could .
thick walls sixties ways , the <unk> to the fortress , thick and doors 're , <unk> , several times <unk> .
i was <unk> at that .
so we thought , i knew that 's what , okay if we do n't get in , then we form a <unk> .
we let 's there 's no more out and pure .
time looking at how long , ' yet that there , goodness .

they had only still a <unk> the was already on the way that says , slaughtered out to be as the <unk> suddenly , to the bishop says , the bishop give me these <unk> and give me three days .
bishop okay , <unk> , what you have you been proven , i <unk> ' into you , come to take control the <unk> and so help us .
<unk> goes with the <unk> way .
suddenly , look down the enemies , how about the wall , the fortress is a <unk> pulled out there is is led and around from left to right and already in the early .
well , thinking , i knew that , a <unk> , what is that already .
it 's <unk> .
again is a <unk> <unk> , up on the wall , the fortress , this time he is , however , black .
enemies are thinking , it turns oh , the still has two <unk> , it can too . ' still something to take you .
at the evening i did the scenario we still time , it this is he knows the <unk> , the there on and go from here is led .
out for the second day , after the six different <unk> have seen the bottom pulled them in a <unk> off .
because they range , we thought , that takes us to long , that we hold on myself not more like .
so then went to the <unk> down to the <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the a , the they had and the they <unk> have .
from that are the <unk> <unk> of about .
what i like , this idea that everything there is , what we need , and that we have anything .
're sometimes it has responsibilities resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's a bit .
but also , so we can now , but do something .
we have no idea of the power shift , we have the world every day to reinvent ourselves .
and if you believe , that could now a good <unk> be then you have right .
in the spring of it 's the spring .
the coming .
and we in <unk> know there goes away the snow , there is a 's warmer and there 's start with the plants , all sorts of branches brown <unk> to green <unk> use .
there are coming blooms at some of sand from these blooms fruits .
there 's get an apple here 's very popular story that we then we harvest and eat .
there 's the grain of this grain , we can then grind and bread , baking .
because there any animals , the light and eat .
there 's real people , the then the products just showed that , and later , food .
and it comes automatically .
if you , but i think about maybe that 's not that automatically everything is then is a 's a fear and so anxious .
and of course is this threat , maybe just very ambiguous and also very theory , but just make in the blooms , the connection of the flower to the plant play the bees fly a very , big role .
there 's research , the showing that the way to <unk> percent of our foods , of certain foods really not there would be if we do n't make bees have done .
also that sounds of water , so <unk> study , because it this is normal for us is , and we need bees might also it 's not that can perceive .
it was happening now ago , some time also a very interesting movie , <unk> , to the subject .
and i recommend you , look at it by , .
now , but look forward , we went on the gentleman <unk> the which is just with the bees are working , the in his high school , in <unk> the importance of bees were much power .
that he doing here to being a school in her <unk> and he 's going to us now have a little bit about his work to tell .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
you first time , a big thank you to respond to mr. <unk> and so , you looked at the <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> specifically <unk> something to contribute to you can think about that live in the bees .
and that 's also still under a wing of a <unk> something about a little <unk> to tell that makes fun .
because i assume you can think , that the most of all of you <unk> working in the are it was very well , tonight is a <unk> company goes , eighteen minutes in the basics of the beekeeping , back into trying to see .
that do i do n't , no .
but it may actually get it me , you to lead to bring that you these <unk> start to love or a certain amount of empathy them to patents to develop and they 're going to engage for this <unk> youth-led , <unk> insect , the honey bee .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years of young , i 'm with a wonderful woman , married , father of five children still not <unk> and what you have different <unk> and <unk> finished and i 've been working <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and in a charity <unk> to the <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> above of <unk> with our oldest students in <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in agriculture and i was in beekeeping .
<unk> is yes , actually a play of <unk> <unk> and of satisfaction from <unk> <unk> .
our flying classroom is a research <unk> , a quiet , a steady thing .
and you when there is also have to be quiet .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and not be for 've already the an ancient greeks the correlation between the honey , so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> have known .
and in a wonderful verse of homer he describes how the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the the sleeping poet , go out of them to him to inspire , it to go back with dense can .
but the <unk> go there was n't about ourselves to do , but they send their blue bees and <unk> now the poet , the lips , with the wax and they crawl in the mouth , into and out of play with him later , the words like the honey , from the <unk> flow .
a gorgeous image .
i hope actually get me that tonight is .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
at one of <unk> , this <unk> the men 's now my students with me together , built have come for 30 kilometers until <unk> days in a <unk> .
in the neighboring schools of us in <unk> into the secondary school or in the <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> or in the <unk> after <unk> .
a <unk> after <unk> or in classrooms we had in <unk> .
the teacher , the project that accompanied goes with me in the class , and we 're looking for a , put in place for that in a <unk> .
mostly at the window , so the children , that you can see during that next month .
and ago all things going to make the bees , the then in there are by the hose out and again <unk> can .
there is then at the window of an open up the created .
so .
and then starting at the big stick with me on the <unk> .
i guess so that in a <unk> and <unk> ' now from a existing <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> you now here in these <unk> in .

also important , we have here <unk> raise their , and here must be on the edge still wearing fresh raise their be , so fresh eggs .
and then one you also a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey is inside .
the need them , if time , bad weather is , and do n't you can fly .
so .
that looks like then from .
then there 's the <unk> here again on it and instantly it starts to the transportation problems of the ground for <unk> where , or the side of this , and <unk> place in the school .
and now starting a beautiful thing .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , these bees , there is inside the then in the class are supposed to experience , suddenly a crisis .
their people on is not anymore .
they are lonely .
they find your queen 's not .
and this is the most important task from <unk> , when he showed this <unk> order to that he put more to pay attention , that the queen sitting in the old people the left us .
that the so not on these two <unk> sitting .
and they 're being sad , these bees .
they 're starting to continue to <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they sums up almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen 's coming together .
and now starting a <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , in a night to do what they are right now the necessity , a new , the people to reasons , and the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , without the conferences , without having , without the opinions and those positions .
here is the nation . they can agree and it used then in the first night , here 's a <unk> .
because without the queen would be one of people right after six weeks , not more exist .
because <unk> lives only six weeks before long .
so .
and in this first night , get them from one of this <unk> a pen out a fertilized egg , and bring that in this <unk> in .
and there <unk> supposed to then you ai queen going to .
everybody , the of you <unk> in the in high had to say , i knew how is it ? because you go ?
yes , genetically <unk> , is yet all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and now starting a beautiful thing .
this egg , what this room typically in the <unk> a cabinets would have been going in the <unk> a queen .

after that will it gets fed up from a <unk> <unk> .
you know that next term .
and instantly it changes , hard on this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> are used by the <unk> in the the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had the earlier , already time i heard that this , what we eat , that determines , what of us will .
and it at the queen is that really wonderful to see .
three days , so an egg , five days <unk> .
and that can the students all witness .
you see that in class .
and they will this cell <unk> with a <unk> wax and the whole thing happens then also not that , because that people right now that democratic , and one <unk> or because a <unk> says , so it going to be , or you republican a task force , says , their power that now .
no , that happens <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> strengthening this .
and then , waiting for the students to eight days , each of my student knows , three , five times eight a queen 's doing so <unk> days that these queen <unk> .
and the day , if that then so happen to decide , the teachers has that wrote down in the the <unk> there <unk> the <unk> done in the students get up to the top five o'clock , yeah .
and then he says the mother , , tell time , which is because with you go ?
yes , i must have to the school .
yes , why that one ?
yes , we 're the queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then we are the morning , according to six in the school .
and then hit the road , their <unk> down ? this point , <unk> , because you witness want to look like this queen 's now <unk> .
and if you that really see that we can then they stop the first is something .
this queen 's whistling .
so .
still a little bit higher .
and then get the <unk> and cut these queen going free .
the first , what these queen of power , they 're due to their wing from and there are now with their <unk> this , the people what to start to myself a queen i pulled it has her own smell , to her <unk> , their <unk> .
the nation has now again an identity .
now be able to three or five days for about this queen fed orally .
of the <unk> front na get them their <unk> <unk> .
the back to come from the they turn out , out of the people right , from this <unk> .
and after five days , flying this queen is unique , from the <unk> out .
some think now , yes , till i was already time ever seen , so a <unk> in <unk> .

what 's completely different .
-- that we let me .
this queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , without the guards , from this <unk> out the way to two miles high .
you have certainly been in time ever seen in your <unk> .
in the <unk> and is there 's in a after an <unk> now <unk> , of seven , until about 12 drones , the male bees .
so the other way as in islam , where the man different women have you can think there 's the queen , the seven , until about 12 , men walking .
and the whole thing happening in a wonderful way in flight .
the drone could come back of the <unk> these queen , and these queen 's being , now in this after an flight , all that , what we use , seeds need to settle for three years eggs to put them .

if you 's done with the <unk> you kill them and fall into the dead , from the sky .
and then there 's the queen goes back , and starts to lay eggs to put them .
it 's always a , two students in the class , the that immediately see .
the also see immediately the queen .
yes .

and then come , i one evening , then before that point , <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> , though , and the next morning <unk> ' i 've got this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and there , here you 're still the queen .
yes .
then again <unk> .
and the way around , mostly , 10 kilometers until about 12 <unk> .
and then it 's this : yes , these two <unk> come from now here in a <unk> .
in a full cane , in a prey and now can use that people the big and vibrant , be .
why bees in the school ?
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , the kids that that have experienced , forget that never more .
yes .
there is yes , not just so , that in this class , then the students all the time with the bees 're together , but the entire school , coming , yes , in this class in .
and the teacher , when it 's something you know , when it 's something can , when he if he was wondering , there something for the future has the can a history , and after the other people join .
let them , bees and it ai a century ago <unk> years we have a cave paintings , where the people have been the honey <unk> have .
i 'm in a few months , you have in israel environment , and years old <unk> found in which the people who at the bees thought would have .
to any human culture has with the bees , breakup .
or vice versa , the bees were born in any culture , man .
in china , in india in persia , in egypt , in greece in rome .
everywhere , they were doing that .
the human cultures , i mean , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> hook , he can a <unk> join .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , you know , which flowers , or the trees , the bees <unk> , what they need ?
that you out there are now , anything you find , now in summer in agriculture .
this out there , that 's a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can find ourselves with the students in the gardening , go and there , flowers and plants , bees are able to become the <unk> you mark and look , how long need the right now , from <unk> up to my flowers ?
how long , they 're on the individuals blooms ?
and how long , they need , until they come back .
he can ai <unk> this right .
how <unk> i a hexagon ?
yes .
you know if that 's so this is that is what the <unk> the top , looking up there 's or ai flat page after the top is ?
you looking for ? right to myself .
he can a math -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can with the students , even the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> explore .
and then , and it goes to the question , how could karl from newly <unk> the nobel prize in getting ?
because he thought , it has that the bees can see that is what the beehive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive , it 's <unk> .
there is something we also a bee has nothing .
and only the professor <unk> , the many years in <unk> , among the university that 's teaching has the has in <unk> figured out that the bees , i knew there a <unk> creating on a single <unk> .
as a <unk> web , from the wax on the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , their <unk> there , bid , and the bees , the <unk> , the pick up with their legs , with their <unk> .
you see , what these bees in the school do ?
it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the kids lose your fear in front of the bees .
and develop an awareness for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , look at that is what the bees do .
and they get a be aware of these creatures which in this issue , just for us people who lives .
the bees do to wax still not time a 70 pounds per capita , the people in the year .
ago <unk> years , the only way , candles making .
they accumulate the side of <unk> out there to the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , based <unk> them their people from .
and now imagine , you want time ago , in summer , that are their sixties -- , <unk> bees on the like a tight space over , <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's the infectious diseases , without end .
well , no choice in the bees do n't .
because they have in this <unk> natural antibiotics .
they accumulate the pollen , and this enables you to him <unk> , he 's about to the <unk> , one being able <unk> .
someone , the edges of the <unk> we 're now is that gets pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can today to a <unk> go and a standard , <unk> dedicated to let , by he the <unk> out of the people the <unk> .
obviously there 's also a grid before and with <unk> with a <unk> and so on , because they did n't happen .
yes , and then i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that pollinating the <unk> that do the bees course also , and we could have less apples , if the bees and there was n't fly would or we have to be like the chinese men 's on the <unk> <unk> and they ourselves , locally .
there 's the very much more of what 's .
if you look at the <unk> , out there on the meadow , is the also the growing on the <unk> , where the cows graze again .
and there are flying the bee to myself , catching up to acquire their nectar and it 's fermented these <unk> .
and now comes the cow and <unk> the <unk> and just , because they <unk> <unk> pick up , can they digest .
yeah ?
and then <unk> you that back and find is , ah , yeah . i 've <unk> <unk> , ah , i can 's and again <unk> .
and then there 's milk .

and i <unk> ' me that i do now , not more with the <unk> learning needs to , but with the hands can learn from .
<unk> , yes , with the head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> secondary school .
and more than the half said , oh yes , that will we also .
my students will see here 's an enormous appreciation and the through all between , in quotes to normal and the are those people are used by the bees pick up .
on playing field to face , you want and they get more self-confidence , my students and a certain amount of the home .
how are you to the bee network ?
the question is wrong .
you would have to say , how are you to the <unk> the the <unk> ?
and there , what i think ' i , also because it 's the person , the the other people <unk> and him a new <unk> there .
and he would say , so , do n't start with it matters .
the end of getting a poem from <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee would be the the sun shining through the <unk> feel that the way to the flower will find and never the direction , you lose the the sides of the fields in <unk> glory of how quickly he also lived , he 'd ever do n't cry .
thank you .
hello , love her friends in spite of the world .
so welcome to show , of my project . .
this off my person and my wife .
it 's the fight for a lot of the end of female <unk> .
in my eyes the greatest crimes of humanity , because it <unk> been around five thousand years .
the society against the women with still have six thousand sacrificing a day .
so first <unk> ' i possibly imagine .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
there , i figured <unk> years a <unk> run .
you can . they can think that me the job , not <unk> has .
and i feel not <unk> .
and it 's why i was glad that i do me in the the subject <unk> well <unk> and compelling amounts of cross the could .
for instance , this .
with a massive <unk> about the news from africa , after brazil .
on the sail a plea for the side of <unk> brazil in the for three days of genocide , among the last <unk> indians the <unk> , to prevent .
that was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
yet we were these large amounts of a match , that interest in the media to find and even a small person like i could his cause to the world to convert language to bring .
<unk> i figured out with firsthand caravan across the <unk> in ethiopia <unk> .
at that was for there war between eritrea , and ethiopia and we were <unk> this killings , there .
and despite all the cruelty , that we were experiencing , we experienced on the other side of the infinity hospitality of the <unk> , the us go into the <unk> , arab hospitality .
and twice . now it that we busted them were and our two guards , that you see here , naturally , with their bodies as living <unk> front of us <unk> , and the <unk> said that are my an environment .
if you did the killing you want , all you by us through it shoot .
something similar i figured out in not another culture has found .
and then , in boys years , already learned that you islam , not can reduce the challenge of terrorism .
also , christians who want to yes , not reduced to be on their terrorism .
for instance , the <unk> .
the <unk> , the <unk> .
but rather on the the true value , how to charity , social responsibility that <unk> .
these are the values , for the road , it 's worthwhile to fight .
after many years after i once again in this <unk> been , along with my wife <unk> .
and because we heard , then , from this <unk> female <unk> .

and the idea was born on the highest , policy issue of islam , and one to bring the practice now to sin to understand .
we 're looking for it <unk> -- in the germans organizations that we have n't find it .
because we had to us , then hear that now we would be yes , probably be completely <unk> , the islam -- was n't even <unk> .
you would i the throat ribbons .
on <unk> of amnesty , international then we have <unk> our own organization , started .
and they were kind of <unk> and <unk> independently .
and the pieces now this battle also at all gain the way to we needed the images .
in it was of a scarcity .
and therefore i moved <unk> and i went back in this desert to stick with the hidden camera these pictures to do .
the bad as a bloody images , that i show you do n't , but i want to doing that crime <unk> .
girl , the age of four weeks , up to myself to the wedding be at some of their parents and related picked , on the earth , we put you what is happening now , there 's the limbs , and cutting them without anesthesia , the clitoris and the <unk> ab <unk> with a <unk> the <unk> to , without anesthesia , with <unk> instruments , without ignoring of hygiene , and the anatomy and the <unk> supposed to attenuate this .
what you are left is a aperture of the size of <unk> .
<unk> takes now one fifteen minutes .
if you your rule get , and ask him to do these two weeks .
we never destroyed her to the body and soul , <unk> their would .
that was the beginning of the so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the virgins 's hear on .
the man has to you open .
he still has never a <unk> woman has seen .
the uncle , have thought he said , oh , ibrahim , is now , but no problem .
where you 're rubbing find your penis , with <unk> a and then come across , you very hard by .
and if you do n't it and she says , is also not bad .
then you kidding , you that knife and <unk> them on .
this is <unk> <unk> .
it is the dying with a third of girl .
these you had three months ago for several .
i 'm in shock has the girl puts his language is lost .
these are the <unk> , also some in asia .
the most are <unk> govern ourselves .
and when are always we are muslims asked , why you have that did ?
she was the <unk> answer , that we need to do , that 's standing in the koran .
nothing is sitting in the koran of them , very in the opposite .
everyone , believing <unk> five times per day in prayer , how is unique <unk> , the creator , is , perfectly , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe , what they were there praying .
they imply <unk> , a <unk> to be the women 's wrong , has created and why that you 're wondering , well as <unk> human <unk> could produce , women <unk> .
but now we had the pictures of the first <unk> was this <unk> .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
it had a tough discussions , for two days .
but we had the minister on our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and then came the great decision , the practice is against all rights , the power to religion , we need to him one minute .
as recently that has the way <unk> this new <unk> signed .
and if you africa and the <unk> knows , you know you , just that has for these people are valid .
and it was celebrating and all these successes , we had then also in other countries .
quick example , still , <unk> there <unk> us the highest spiritual , the <unk> the country , his message that it is a crime is , on <unk> to write and that now in the <unk> to wear .
for weeks , we were his way , with your own <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had along .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical , the holy hospitality , experienced .
and when we the country , eventually leaving wanted said the big scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want now really all <unk> countries are focused on ?
so much lifetime will <unk> you did n't even more give them .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and there you have to slow to the thing to come .
and do so , he had an idea .
he said , if it tells you can really , the ten <unk> muslims in the world to one of the table to earth and the explain the practice now to sin , then it 's a sin .
<unk> and i went and after the cairo , in the <unk> and -- the mosque comparable to do with the vatican , the <unk> .
and on the <unk> for <unk> right now at the <unk> , his <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he listened to start to the idea of pollution was thrilled , mostly , when we him the notion that we keep the finance would .
and that we doing that i just about the funders are some of us support .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference , not just <unk> , so how we know it 's why they asked had , but i 'm going to the <unk> take over .
and that has he did .
over cairo <unk> some point in the years <unk> our government transparent .

under the <unk> years of the <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> .
and all these are they come .
a hundred guards , but the highest in the world .
in the middle of <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and in the rest of europe , he 's the activity in the head <unk> 's because of cartoons .
so men the life and death can decide .
but just might also the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right , the <unk> , my <unk> .
the highest in the world .
about where i 'll ask <unk> me just still a vacuum ago , and <unk> personally .
and then i figured out they all accommodates one .
it started the conference .
and under our sign at the <unk> from left <unk> of egypt .
the <unk> <unk> the <unk> egypt , <unk> of that she was mubarak and <unk> <unk> , germany .
so much to the subject , the islam is not <unk> .
we had also the doctors , but using the on their way we still time <unk> , what 's a terrible , you women , because it does to , with the <unk> .
and then you for <unk> your film to show <unk> .
reality .
the men had wet eyes .
what they were wondering , back behind <unk> doors , after only two hours , you had decided , and a <unk> wrote , a <unk> .
the <unk> kick in front of the cameras , announced , what you decided to produce .
and the most important set in it , that was this .
female <unk> is a <unk> crime , that against the highest values science of islam and it goes .

we thought , the job is done had , but the calculation , without our <unk> done .
because the shame , over the abdomen , the woman to talk , is stronger remained as any mind .
it 's why we have <unk> .
we have this we have the conference , documented in this so-called `` golden book .
a <unk> for the <unk> this world .
and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it so well , i found , this book , it , he 's with a co , bless .
it gets us from the hands of rent .
we were in many countries had then conferences , this right with the different parts of the highest <unk> .
and they all read that with interest in some were so excited you to the book <unk> have .
unfortunately , but we have the most not the courage attached to that now also to announce that .
over the abdomen , the woman can hope you 're not in the mosque to talk .
just some have the courage upset .
they 're at least in the universities , you go , on <unk> .
and sometimes we have some of bold <unk> found the fact , in the mosque about <unk> have , like here .
and then it goes beyond what about some speakers in the <unk> .
and that are yes , the affected .
the will it spread .
but let me running the of time .
it are all drop on the hot rocks , and it 's why i 'm building , among many other strategy , this topic is still <unk> .
the practice of arguments that .
but my <unk> that would this .
i want to the great message the highest <unk> the world to announce at the birthplace of nuclear power of islam is over here , among the kaaba , in mecca .
not come out , so <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if here four million people come together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> ' i do with all of which and the the <unk> king of my transparent up there between the minarets if you will .
how i showed this already time a whole variety of have in the <unk> .
unfortunately i 've not only , the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he said of <unk> would he would join .
one thing , to find these women to help .
to the other to pick the world time to show , which the real love the values science of islam , are , instead of water , the time to demonstrate to them .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i think that 's not manage and then <unk> ' i might this , what in hamburg is already its first had .
that at least a lot of <unk> in the mosques in our part in spite of the world .
and we our transparent , there , if you will be that .
and maybe i experience i do it 's still certain that little girl puts his daughters were n't even more <unk> should .
then , which , my life so now let 's worth it .
and i want appeal to see that every , the this now heard has seen or has to join .
also not be part is already a <unk> .
we need to the practice in the ton step , otherwise we learn and i 'm here from this stage , you ca n't go down .
and now i want you conclude the first draft of my <unk> already , even show .
this is my <unk> , my <unk> .

down there we have it then also in german .
female <unk> is with the koran , and the ethics , '' of islam , incompatible .
you is <unk> and one of discrimination and science of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm actually ' so that time to time .
so we looked at the <unk> from a , you as a refugee , in germany would get .
at the <unk> attention <unk> have my mother , my brother and i was the first time , so a package <unk> .
it it made <unk> .
my mom was be completely terrified , because they did n't understand that has why the us now rotten food have given .
the third day , we were finally i resolved .
we were on the side of trash wanted this stuff back to throw away then came a <unk> wife and <unk> that easy to , and <unk> from .
they tried to us to explain , hey , that you can eat .
that 's not <unk> .
that tastes like even very well .
it 's the cheese .
my mother was taken the eyebrows , up and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my own country , we have is , to <unk> but the has not so <unk> to smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
i 'm in fifteen years , i came to my mother and my brother of china has been , germany , and fled .
of this escape <unk> ' i was able to tell .
but do so , it 's about me to it , which to the people that cause the run out how to have and to a success did .
but first , tell ' i them , where now , i 'm from .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> , the in the northwest of china life .
and this region is from the chinese that autonomous area <unk> called .
it 's up about <unk> miles from germany away .
in china to live in total to 10 million <unk> but in munich is the biggest <unk> community outside of china .
and these <unk> life , and so here because we in china under constant , human rights are suffering have to .
hundreds of chinese were trying to get after <unk> relocated , so we in our own home to a sizable minority become aware .
our own native language , <unk> was out of the education is basically .
in schools and in university will only still in chinese were taught .

the <unk> losing so they do their culture and identity .
and if , it’s someone courageous thing is , and for the right to the <unk> in the pursuit may become a long sentences , torture , or even after death .
that was also the reason , why my parents laughing , that what we 've decided , with us kids to escape .
that was <unk> and i was back to 11 years old .
this picture is a moment ago , our escape from that point .
we did n't enough money , why my father had only time behind .
i <unk> ' me of many people , the us in the run have helped .
i <unk> ' me of many images .
i <unk> ' me , but first tunnels , <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i just know , ' him exactly the front of me , when i my eyes <unk> .
he was big had an ai <unk> matter to mix , and we met him always with his little <unk> on a parking lot .
the first rate was going to pass .
i know that many a negative image of <unk> have that the only do business plan to refugees exploit , little n't wait for the fates to care .
but i <unk> ' say , i <unk> ' him as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> has us for months accompanied shops .
he stood the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last thing for <unk> , whether we also really sure , through the <unk> came .
airport in <unk> we came , everything else , and i know , still , as my mother of had to me and said , there 's not just turned out from the local airport .
turns out to you do n't anybody .
until we are out .
because i had that is , in my hand a pass and there was also my photo in here , but there was put a total stranger name , <unk> .
i had as <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> ' me of <unk> <unk> the me was looking at he had my watch out in my hand .
silence .
and sweat .
a long view .
we were finally <unk> .
in munich , came <unk> ' i told me of a lot of the first responders , the us kind very strongly supported by accident .
i <unk> ' me of the <unk> woman , the with us in <unk> are used by .

at least one house for children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
it had a stranger who 's faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> share .
there was eating , you 've made and homework done .

just mean <unk> the <unk> in the <unk> knew me know .
they knew my story and ostensibly me very , and they took care , they 've been to me .
for instance , brought them to me to <unk> <unk> what i now , not more i do .
but they helped me also kind , german attendance to meet .
i spent my whole puberty , in <unk> .
that was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with us kids , without your husband and always in the uncertainty , because we had yes , just a <unk> and we could have any time <unk> be .
i <unk> ' me that showed that i do very , aggressively , was to the time .
it 's me also slightly embarrassing , this now here 's all to tell , but now i must be easy to my in history .
i was very aggressive and i could tell me in the school bad at some way to focus .
that brought us the first place to the catholic <unk> where we 're going to the first time with the normal young kids in touch were coming .
with a normal , my goodness ' i children , the not in a <unk> live , had .
i <unk> ' me , too the <unk> the me and my brother . to so those or <unk> sent to have .
just so we bit emerge .
i <unk> ' i was also , among several <unk> <unk> the with us homework done have , because our parents do n't speak german , could .
or the have with us , just a painting .
we 've become always very was really happy .
i know , still , how we always the brink of fence , were and waited until these people came , because , somehow were eating , totally foreign people for us time , and that was telling us at that matters .
after two years , finally got my father , sort of germany .
the problem was , but that he 's directly from <unk> after <unk> <unk> was because it in munich , whereas the no room , more for him , there .
i <unk> ' me of the very , who are being lawyer , the done it has , my father in front of the <unk> after china to keep us they made it even that he 's we had in munich live up to lead .
i <unk> ' me of this time where i really , and then you very , happy i was , because after six years <unk> allowed to we finally in a normal place to draw .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we had finally one of your own apartment , with a own somewhere , and a , in your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was that is , very small and i did n't have desk in it , but it was good , i could my door in -- .
and i <unk> ' me that i the time , yes , very well be some of have , but i had yet the <unk> without a school , and leave .
i looked for me really not a perspective .
there was having a <unk> , made me in <unk> always been supported by chance , and it still does with the idea that i about the second and exposing , my with degrees <unk> can .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
i thank the teacher , the really respond to me , we thought , and i was really not easy to the time , and made i do it even down to the middle have at .
after i came to the <unk> .
and before i started to <unk> came i played the way , with my best friend <unk> rate , <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project , the self organized <unk> .

we had a valve that 's been doing what we our <unk> <unk> could .
and the heads of <unk> helped us some way that we our problems with him to tell you could and he was ostensibly us and i could tell us in all kinds of questions , somehow help you .
and after i came to the <unk> , <unk> .
and that 's a project , where young people without a major in the opportunity to get more , here , this artistic <unk> .
that has to me really very well done , and . i 've begun , art is something which i was also slightly <unk> .
by <unk> and the connect to <unk> came a filmmaker , on us .
he made the movie <unk> about the lives of my friends and me .
and the film he won lots of prices .
we we realized that the indus people wondering , for our story was interested .
he was a very special feeling , because we do it 's still never experienced had learned that people we can be listened to have .
and that was so a moment , where i thought , okay .
i do n't want more <unk> .
i want to say anything from my life make .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees , came to me on the idea for instance , to a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to join .
but because i put in the <unk> building me totally get lost had ended up i happened to arrive at a <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was just right .
i was playing with .
and the cool thing is that , after a performance , two editors , from <unk> broadcasting on me <unk> .
and asked me , had , if i interest should have just time our own <unk> to do .
so i thought , super , <unk> .
it is we do what ' i do with .
and i made for the radio program <unk> , now , pulse <unk> and a friend of posts about a play <unk> , in the side , i also ourselves <unk> was for the european <unk> nominated vice versa .
and i 've got it also actually won .
now -- and study i 'm able to the college , for <unk> and movie munich <unk> already the third year , and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and all this would have to me to do n't been possible if not individual or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , hard for me are used to have done .
they 've got back to me , we did you have to me spaces opened , they have to me ways to be so , as i my place in society me <unk> can .
and so that come ' i now to them .
each of you has the possibility , people like me to help the second chance to get and their lives or their place in society to find .
because , the people , from day come to shrink a hundred million refugees , sort munich , and each of you 're with hope and each of you has a big potential .
they have it with great and determination and there a lot of awful hurdles , behind , hard to them .
and with this determination , could you really big for profit for germany will be , and for every single one of us as well .
and i could actually a thousand critical things tell , what you can do with , but because i do n't even more than enough time , to have even though there it , a minute and fifty , i put them a <unk> brought .
whip them now your cellphone out they ca n't tell me tell you to no code <unk> can .
then scan them the code , that , and then they come on the side of <unk> with many possibilities for , what they have no way we can do .
and that would allow us very good to help .
i <unk> me already now time for their engagement and we see us out , i hope .
and then scan them the code , a .
i just know , ' it .
many have the phone n't even in my hand .
are you guys so <unk> become , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yes .
you first time a <unk> <unk> forgery .

he has it already have known , before i told him as such <unk> 've gone .
he has to me , organized into the price of this just fell in , then as i would he told me <unk> let me .
i could do to me later still in him <unk> .
i quit after him the joy done .
it , as <unk> ago all other days <unk> and me back to sleep we put it .
with a <unk> <unk> in the face where else ?
and purpose , it not anymore to be celebrating , by i <unk> .
and should i later , but once again , wake up it 's able to start to do n't need to change a <unk> day traded one time .
there hope , right ?
now it 's time for a little joke .
what i said to albert einstein , when he would be a steak , not she liked ?
i of q .
so .
the letter q sounds like the cow .
it 's why this funny .
yes , the next text , has also the paper her name learned .
this is more what political activism .
so , i write ' not just a funny things .
i write ' also partially very political things .
and is , they 'll figure ' i often wondered , where i <unk> ' .

he carries the title <unk> .
my dad came from vienna , then in my mother and i from her .
yes .
we would have the <unk> .
thank you for the sound .
yes , this point , in , <unk> ' i 'd like a bit of ads are doing .
i can see me , no business cards , or so afford , therefore i have to that always <unk> do .
and it 's this <unk> ' i also ourselves , events and i <unk> also ourselves a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
can walk like time i show up .
and yes , i <unk> ' , i <unk> ' actually very <unk> .
and , yeah .
that you want , ' i just have said .
it goes further in the program .
more advertising .

feet .
rich , among them vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin a toe .
already time , very funny .
i want , ' a joke about the <unk> about your friend of writing , but that punchline was just the flat .
yes , is not been on my <unk> .

yes .
thank you for a 's listening .
her for joining great .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
, let me the same with a <unk> question i started .
why you going to <unk> at all run ?

the answer is very clear .
we know that now , that the life expectancy , to go at the birth , just to about <unk> percent of genetically <unk> is .
that means that it must have any of environmental , <unk> give the impact on <unk> have .
why we know it still so little ?
why we will be equivalent of the of <unk> news out of the <unk> , the road , to the part of each other these , ?
you remember wondering , all of years ago fifteen years , it seemed to the guilty found .
it was fat .

what to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves , with different <unk> in american way the has led and what does n't come from it has changed , that the americans every year and along become aware .
then , you have said , ah , no .
now , but not the fat .
it are the carbs .
then what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so on has led .
it is so again and ai new <unk> hurdle , through a 's a village <unk> .
so where the whole <unk> ?
now , the reason is , for my taste , for part of the least , that we by <unk> <unk> approaches anecdotal <unk> to the science and wisdom <unk> .
example in for a <unk> as different is here .
the <unk> you know of all .
<unk> published a lot <unk> magazine , a new <unk> .
the top , <unk> the <unk> <unk> for this is next year .
keith richards , was seven years long on the place one nominated vice versa .
then he died in the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest person , the shows that ever attempted on the earth , lived by .
<unk> years old become .
i know , there 's somewhere , people , the claim , they are six hundred , can but just your <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> become .
and they rang up with <unk> on to smoke started , but with <unk> back to continue to try and then finally , with <unk> <unk> the the path of the virtue to follow and to stop to smoke .
with <unk> is they then he died .
what that tell us ?
not enough of cigarettes , healthy food supply .
but it tells us , that an aging , very complicated is , and that we need clean , what 's really need we need a simple experimental systems and we need to just might ask questions .

of is not is that ?
we know it has since .
that 's because there on testosterone up at the <unk> so , which in the male <unk> produced is .
and there 's <unk> very simple evidence for <unk> men to be exactly as old women .
you can now everybody for to itself , think if that 's a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a free licensing the country .
but it come still better tips , not afraid .
general , we going to us hats correlation with <unk> to confuse morality .
sounds complicated , is , but simply respond to the usual <unk> to illustrate .
there goes to so someone ai <unk> grandma , and asks , what they have , because so different done or else was eating that they do that old become are ?
ah .
the , '' which has a day every decade of cigarettes <unk> .
this is probably the secret of their ages , right ?


ourselves hard statistics are not always <unk> .
there for instance , ai very hard statistics , that shows that people , the <unk> in the <unk> visit the older be as people that do n't do this .
reciprocal .
is <unk> .
and what is the edges of the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because it reminds me , and the people just enough money in the bag have happened to be wondering , well , according to her age and the <unk> diseases to take care .
if i but a group of <unk> a <unk> to the forage and give them and this group to `` twenty percent live longer than it ai to a group that the <unk> just might not get it has , but otherwise very the exact same weight on was then i figured actually probably a <unk> factor in the diet affected .
and actually are doing these attempts have been done .
to tell you , the <unk> is very <unk> at , but even i do with my enemies agree 'm is , the twin fast at the life going up .
and this works for the all different organisms .
for instance , in using bacteria .
you see here , ai <unk> of bacteria .
if we the fast at , in the <unk> line showing then life that were much longer .
and the same for <unk> , <unk> flying over mice and recently was only ago about two years in the united states has shown that 's even for the monkey is true .
and ted 's hear n't about , thin to be .
it works as well arrive at <unk> the <unk> kitchen .
and that 's a another experiment , what in the united states has been done .
what has you did here ?
you has an ai <unk> taken and has the one , so many so-called <unk> to human , a <unk> diet , where you so , so many <unk> this one day and night get depressed .
and who you wonder 's it , the mice are wonderfully thick and become , sick and have an ai very pretty bad <unk> suppose , and bad <unk> .
now has you ai in common with <unk> taken and that has the right in the same number of <unk> fed up just that your moment ai is go to be .
the have the day , do n't eat just to the , for that they have the morning at twice as much eating .

even though , both of mice <unk> is feeding were .
both have the same as much eating .
the a sick and the other healthy .
so what happens really ?
it is a process called the cellular <unk> or <unk> clicked on .
when are always tell you organisms , or will take food taken away then it starts to the organism to time , redundant ingredients in the cell or degraded constituents of mining project to turn it again , energy to do .
that makes sense .
and that looks like this .
you can see , like in the cell in fact , it . they can <unk> form of making space to junk , played on the ages <unk> .
the one form , then with the stomach , the ingredients to be <unk> and the cell as energy back available to get asked .
it makes us to be one you damage that the age accumulate in the limits in touch .

so to knock it <unk> twin fast at they spread that live in these different organisms .
and it 's probably , not another thing that we also in people work .
and we learn from this is , they just might not like in <unk> recommended , every little <unk> on day with two decades , <unk> fight are to .
no .
but , they should have to start to say , if you 're hungry , have , ah , maybe it 'll just the <unk> clicked on .
welcome you your hunger , as a friend .
and that makes it also <unk> sense .
while <unk> decimal point where nine nine percent of the human history has the human being what did , if he was hungry , had ?
alright , he 's chase you 've gone .
we go to regularly , among the fridge , hunting , if we 're hungry all that .
and that 's safe against the biology .
now we know of course , and that means is already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is <unk> , but the meat is weak .
the garden , looks for us very different from .
here 's already kind of <unk> <unk> in a medieval paradise . that

and this is , so to the really the <unk> .
we have us , and so on the quest for really all made a , the molecular answer them the <unk> turn up , although the organism eat .
this could for people to be interesting , whose <unk> not enough to leave you <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could make us might ago , one of the hardest <unk> of life in preserve .
the question is so we in the <unk> , the <unk> , the cellular <unk> turn up , although you eat ?
and we have many hundreds , the day of thousand really all scans , natural really all .
we have , indeed a found , that means <unk> .
<unk> is a solid substance , the in all of organisms , naturally does seem the but also in all of organisms , during the halt even less will .
in your skin is it at the <unk> .
<unk> people have already there were much less <unk> in your skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells to give , the example , then you see , but here .
this is an ai is through the cell here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> on it and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell that allows the the junk , played on the ages <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells that would very , just look like this .
and this works in these different organisms .
here for instance , showing relative to a <unk> .
so we have an ai substance found that the molecular <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
life , because the organisms , so we also known for .
and the answer is again , yes , you see here , ai typical <unk> of a <unk> .
it are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days are the all dead , after the house for days is about the half of dead .
when are always we <unk> into the water for giving , here in colorful characters are the animals are older and surviving better .
we also know , that human cells that we of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have in culture , about three times that long to survive , if we do you with <unk> put themselves .
and the latest research , we put them , too close that even the lives of all over mice , through <unk> going up going .
and it 's not only that life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are clearly <unk> .
so .
now you want to course , all know , where it comes <unk> ago ?
how the name was already says , it 's in the sperm being discovered yet been , because it comes in very high concentrations of years ago .

we have us , then i said , if <unk> against <unk> helps , by it the junk <unk> fix it then , we might also against <unk> ?
they have to find is to know , the common point of all <unk> diseases is that during the ages <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we have , indeed experiments that we were done .
they will be wondering , wondering , we have the edges of flies done .
man that will see , you <unk> , if you to age .
they have more <unk> in the brain , if you to age .
and the molecular mechanisms that fit for memory , are areas of these are very much like the side of people .
now ask , you want yet , how to the devil has the fellow the memory of flies measured it ?
this is the experiment , what we put together with stefan seals from the college in berlin did .
you take a hundred flies and they suspend the here 's a give which is a different smell , , the they love .
<unk> .
and let the road , in this <unk> <unk> .
then they take the same fly to give them in the next chamber , and give you <unk> other smell , , the they love , which is <unk> .
we do you make the <unk> enjoy , while you , but it ai <unk> <unk> .
the classic <unk> .
then take them back the same fly to do the here in play .
the drive here 's degree in the <unk> down , there you that .
and if you down here which makes you 're going to give them from the one side <unk> and of other side <unk> on this .
where you go into the all about to do ?
i realized .
now to <unk> .
except the wonderful here .
these are the <unk> .
or , we say , they have a character .
i love my <unk> and i , let ' i was n't by hook it ai <unk> reward <unk> .
okay .
this is , but it ai form of making a character , the with the age increases .
not only at flying .
and we could actually the <unk> the fly through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , i going to go back to bring .
and the <unk> , the in the brain can come about were , were back in mined land .
that go <unk> it affects not just to , and aging , but also against <unk> diseases , maybe some .
and that 's important , because we want yes , the <unk> not the span of votes in se extend .
it does n't make sense , the era of <unk> to extend .
and i want you do n't putting them , without you still time a few practical , tips , to do we we maybe some younger women stay .
still time <unk> fast at .
it 's not about , that you weight , reduced , or something .
there 's the way that now in austria ai group of <unk> people , the a day to eat and a day , do n't eat .

and the keep the very well , through .
that is , it 's <unk> .
and avoid them <unk> .
it ca n't interface , carbs , complex carbs seem does n't even dangerous . .
it goes really , to a candy .

and you know it 's , that sugar the growth of tumors -- accelerate can .
here you ai <unk> , the ago , hard to myself ages .
after only 30 days are the all dead .
very low doses of glucose in the eyes out .
to change a <unk> effect to create .
there 's just an example , that works in almost all of organisms that way .
food they regularly fruit and vegetables .
and avoid them the gift of to a lot <unk> or of <unk> at all .
you know that now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer can manage .
this is true , not under the circumstances for them vitamin d .
we 're here maybe some degrees ' in winter , a <unk> , because vitamin d is by sunlight on the skin is building .
in some of them at least three times per week , ai half hour of sports , that 's trivial .
cigarettes , despite the elation <unk> examples of cost you <unk> 10 kilometers until fifteen years lifetime .
do , you want in times the play with this , <unk> occasionally the rest for smaller .
the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life expectancy is that 's coral .
because the monks of lives almost like this long , ' how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> lives are still no longer than <unk> .
just <unk> die , sooner than <unk> .
of is not is that ?
the people assume , that has to engage with some reason really all to do .

if now here 's a <unk> at the window is then <unk> ' i the with <unk> <unk> answer either way .
and what kind of thing happens , probably in her around for .
<unk> scaling , <unk> and so what to be by drinking under the circumstances , there <unk> .
therefore , has to get you do so , ai <unk> effect .
a permanent partner have or ai 's family with increasing longevity is associated with .
they should n't have to being a lot of the busiest street you live .
now if you see the same <unk> .
that has but with <unk> it 's nothing to do .
it goes to find <unk> .
you can measure ever been closer to someone to being a lot of the busiest street who lives , you cut more <unk> did he in the blood .
and that 's , when he says , i was doing it has always has done used .
i can already well sleep and the noise that makes me anything from .
not true .
he has yet , more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
to sun would anyone could go through be because of <unk> course .
we know that now , that <unk> very good metabolic effects would .
do so , it that the <unk> lower .
and we also know that <unk> and <unk> mice , against the infectious to protect .
knew that way our grandmothers will also been in the us with <unk> and so on <unk> have .

several different studies of evidence , that dark chocolate , not to have dementia <unk> work today can .
just recently is a beautiful study <unk> , that has shown that using ai n't totally panel of dark chocolate , a day , the <unk> of a <unk> on the level of a <unk> bring can .
similar suspected that you of coffee there 's the , looking at but it thinner .
there 's trials , the that show , there 's studies that do n't that show .
what 's clear , this is that coffee to , and diabetes <unk> it 's working system and their metabolic performance better is .
and the coffee is actually also a good <unk> because he solves <unk> from , how we put together with <unk> <unk> of paris to show you could .
ai very nice and intricate study in the hundred thousand people to fifteen years long , studied computers were have shown that people , that every day , ai handful of nuts and eat their <unk> to be -- twenty percent mortality down .
this is , a huge value for the ai <unk> study .
and this is for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but does n't for the peanuts , the <unk> seen actually , beans in cities .
the give just have to , by , you want nuts call , okay .
that are , but actually , beans .
so for the peanuts and so is n't that .
the next thing is a little <unk> .
and avoid them the tape of to a lot of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , but only , if you between <unk> and <unk> years old are .


generally not do you <unk> .
what do anything that they do to remain they <unk> that i knew already , friedrich nietzsche that 's in has said the important to say , the <unk> , that a happy or actually the <unk> are signs of the health .
everything <unk> heard in the pathology lab .
this is at the gentleman <unk> <unk> the has about after this regime that lived and he 's <unk> years old become .
it out of my home <unk> out of the <unk> , is never get sick and become .
and all it 's hear very well .
he 's just might not a <unk> as different not an anecdote , but he lives in a <unk> , where it 's particularly a lot of healthy <unk> there .
he has about the <unk> followed , i went to you today i said , to have .
we should , in all the <unk> way it ai important fact , though not to overlook .

you <unk> the old people less to and that could one of the <unk> mistake of our culture be .
<unk> wrote the biggest novel , the <unk> a year ago , he died .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece is to with the the contemporary critics do so , the adolescents and fresh <unk> .
i thank you for listening .
i want to start with a question , i went to them in place .
a question , where now , no up , you must , because that 's a bit of intimacy is a lot of you who 's very lonely ?
the output is yet , very low .
lower power , when i thought .

many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and think that would be <unk> .
and offers is that does n't even the case .
will see , and loneliness is actually more like a phenomenon , given people as alone to be .
maybe that 's it also running this is , they range , not reported have , because the question , fuzzy as a matter is .
like to be wondering , lonely , or is you very lonely ?
you can be wondering , lonely , feel anything , lonely , to be .
and you can be lonely be without the road , in the moment lonely , to feel .
and loneliness that has also a lot with a shame , to do .
also this is some now here to stop the have , naturally , to loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness that leads in the shame and shame , leads in loneliness .
and loneliness takes time .
also , so we will be wondering , now here , none of reported have in the few seconds , which i do you gave you 've gone .
and loneliness to drive <unk> .
and loneliness to drive the time to stand here , this yours at all aware enough to be .
and loneliness need also practice which to talk about being able to .
and this exercise have that we all into action .
we have that neither the language is still have we sign for us even to see it whenever we are lonely ?
there 's pockets of loneliness to two <unk> , which i again and once in 'm .
the one part of humanity , says , you is from beginning of course of the lonely .
of the birth to the cell death is you just really lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
this kind of people go and then we often to <unk> and the steering , it’s the whole day off .
i cried . ' no time , is so your <unk> .
and then there 's people might be less in our country , the say , everything is with all connected .
that i think there 's not actually , so , i 's just a part of the the big universe .
and there 's the great group , to the i also am the time , so , time thinking that .
the thinking , okay , today i a lonely and the next day , oh , it depends on yet , and it all together .
if we hold of loneliness to think falls within us always begin with the very large and loneliness is a a .
the loneliness years of the <unk> , the loneliness to the person with on one of intensive care .
but about this <unk> , about these big <unk> <unk> ' i like to do n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , over the everyday <unk> , where loneliness to us also in the like a theater to face can .
i want to also do n't talk about the burden , and <unk> years of the <unk> .
and loneliness to performing other to detect of making us , mostly , not difficult and loneliness , unlike us to detect <unk> already .
the photographer christine tailors , has the break a few pictures made a , i show you want .
how easy it gives us this , it falls over , and other , and loneliness to detect .
and first know what we all not , whether these people , it’s really in this moment lonely felt .
but who knows it 's not , the moment on so <unk> event , where you might think , all talk to each other , just to fix itself is largely lost something in the corner and has anyone to the <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness to know the safe here all .
may have some they also now have ever experienced .
what you 're driving it does , you put that cell phone in something very often , also that could you today , so , you 're seeing is that <unk> , that <unk> on the phone coverage , an escape the brink of <unk> .
clearly , visible , if you on the display , look .
what we now this is n't do .
yes , and then there 's the loneliness to the types of years ago you sitting on the loneliness is one of <unk> on <unk> stage , hundreds of <unk> faces have a huge and you even something left in the hope , that you its actual text , not forget that .
these are the <unk> , that you , though it looks .
that we other people we ascribe them .
but i 'm really sure , there 's here also people in the room , the road , from birth day of the lonely , feel that all their life for so he spent have , by showing you have tried to these loneliness of sorrow . <unk> , to start to distract ourselves .
and there 's in this room can guarantee you also people the lonely , are , because they 're on a other people get rid of the need to be so it because of light of death or because of a separation .
there 's using it also have nothing , that still so many people , also people , with which they 're connected to stand around them are you feel politics . lonely .
and there 's people , the have the to the whole range , even lost find no contact with more likely to be wondering , and are why a lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit down , ' her as well , the analog loneliness .
the analog loneliness is we can be familiar .
that are people are moments after their opinion , after it 's no shortage , does social business leaders .
also that 's always be relatively .
there 's not an official number , not an arbitrary number , whenever somebody coming to human connecting it has , when i do n't .
we can be cut down there right away the old people a .
it 's the analog form of the loneliness .
since we but everybody in cities of living , connected with very many people in using facebook or by definition , twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness bigger and become .
you can do with hundreds of people connected to be anything , with a single people get really connected to be .
it 's it at the analog loneliness is more like the quantity of human relationships , the missing is it at the digital loneliness the quality of relationships .
the two forms of the loneliness to be very often the other , <unk> .
this is is also running this , that the analog loneliness is a little <unk> <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness to start to well suitable for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's none of data point that the digital loneliness to the future is still gain is when the ways that , hard to connect to be bigger .
i do n't know , if you in twenty years that feeling that the top of our from loneliness is very similar to be going to still loneliness to call it will .
or whether you for and then a new word that will find .
but that are also , so to the problems of the successional generation .
almost like , it bigger than the loneliness to itself is the fear in front of the loneliness and from this fear in front of the loneliness that are people have a little to do n't ready .
<unk> , the big <unk> , also a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in the the description of them , what people do everything to get you 're not alone to be .
they build cathedrals , they were witnesses children , the then again , lonely , are and alone .
but that <unk> has n't they named after the radiation , by the front of the loneliness to kick out , which is spend money .
shop , go .
things the proud .
both the process get through already the loneliness to because it at least a short run a contact -- now than that , the objects themselves , that you just acquired by .
only problem is that 's very quickly led to help me and holding , this kind of those potions against the loneliness .
therefore we need to again and new things to buy us forward to <unk> .
i cried . ' time the ads for a a <unk> panties label seen .

what this at my panties , to do it has to know you do n't , but apparently you can also that .
and loneliness that has so nothing with the <unk> to do loneliness find under the people , just so instead .

hand on a 's heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship , waking up or the or the other , during the brushing to see and wondering , suddenly , terrible alone to feel , terrible lonely , to feel and the question to ask , who is this man 's really ?

a study published saying that naturally , at the <unk> women , around the fifty , married , with kids , feel .

but it 's also now radically different matter because it at least in studies , most of matter is , and the response is always the same is that the people in front of me <unk> .
that that intuitive , so completely obvious thing is , almost as it is a <unk> .

talk , just so little bit about the loneliness to investigate the sex .
this is also has it 's probably everybody has experienced .
it , a while you <unk> is naturally , suddenly to think , what do what ' i 'm here 's really ?
who is this person in my bed , really ?
this is also a form of loneliness that 's not about what to do have to come up with the quality means that the sexual <unk> .
also have nothing to do have to come up with the quality of relationship .
they just is always there .
we speak only do n't about them , because we do n't you look .
we speak only ways , not about them in the workforce .
in the workforce is the loneliness is also <unk> when we think .

the two men have to start to having to the two women in a costume designers have , they 've entertained .
and between , it said something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in my hand of our own intern .
i think i made , i have to you the scene n't even further to carry out , so you that form of loneliness that everybody 's also been in time you 're in the fabric has experienced , again <unk> can .
it 's the the loneliness years of the <unk> .
it 's but also the loneliness years of the <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , sit here might also some of the their lives <unk> to see that <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> in the hotels , in your bags bars that often also do n't know more , who they actually are , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
also that 's a form of loneliness to about the not talking about how will .
just heard it also <unk> , how much more loneliness than <unk> misuse it can be .
<unk> is here for insulation .
let me has time a <unk> told that he 's called , was from a client , and the has said , it 's what 's very , then , this happens , you can do it you did n't imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so that has he to itself to the <unk> guy 's .
and two months later , he 's also <unk> .
the loneliness is how to have n't alone , and so .
they come always in touch with other feelings .
you has beautiful siblings and they has really ugly siblings .
the ugly siblings , we know all .
fear , sadness in despair , anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful siblings , not forget .
the freedom of the proud of the desire that <unk> .
so we had my plea can look , you want the loneliness to time .
come and goes in life as the tide , and floods occur .
let them to and let them , it’s not from her drive up .
because there 's still something much even worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that may after the loneliness to come when you do n't , and more you can feel .
and loneliness is part of life .
since i so hard about loneliness been thinking of have to have been wondering , for me two things that changed .

i think about it 's as i 've managed , since i the loneliness in my life accepted , to have people come and go to them .
this is exactly what it with the <unk> , that you so does .
also because i a free and become .
people come and go to let them , they do n't even more sensitive to to and millions , whether the road , from a close encounter a friendship , or even a partnership to what 's could .
as a child i found my parents to find an embarrassing .
the can , does n't leave <unk> by , without working with somebody a conversation with anybody .
whether in the <unk> or in the economy .
every time led it to an infinite talking .
as a child i found that as i said embarrassing .
as young adults , and i figured out , you just looking for it <unk> the way to get this openness to have .
but first since i even so with the loneliness to work with you have more , trying to get it me at least to do , and again , i was also <unk> so to open .
you see it 's and lonely be called road , willing to do for the next performance .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i cried . ' here three , i seem , man .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now <unk> ' i do you if you just once to access one you believe the drew would you take ?
the most people would naturally , for the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we do with the least of effort on the back on land make major .
in human health , we doing this kind of different .
because we let the activity , with the biggest effect , completely other than eight and decide to us for other strategy .
we decide to us , for example for the <unk> and the is for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we decide to us for the <unk> .
the is for diet .
also very large <unk> but still very big effort .
for me , so i also not so valuable .
and i want you today , telling how they do with the least of effort into the biggest <unk> would get .
if you 're going to start with hiv prevention and health , engaged , you going to manage to a subject does n't you , right around ; it .
and the issue , is not overweight .
and the theme of obesity , was in germany , long time , no issue , so roughly equivalent to in the <unk> .
and then joined the number of obese people in germany , actually , what matters .
and i was doing was thinking , what was there go in the <unk> ?
why i went to go like this soaring suddenly , looking up ?
and then i figured of research and i 'm also <unk> become .
because it was right in the years <unk> .
what was there ?
there she came <unk> after germany .
and we 're going to and over and along ?
and i picked up on , i watched .
<unk> comes to go for solid , germany .
and that obesity is increasing .
and in the years <unk> take the rate is still time , right away to the journey on .
and what 's coming then after germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how do all this means .
and we 're going to and over and along ?
well i , then i figured , one , and one , cleared .
because it was yes , i realized .
sports and makes a thick .
and of course <unk> ' i now not here , for me to say , that the sport , dick 's doing .
because that 's not true .
but one , we 've now let 's all of have .
the flood of always a new and training -- and <unk> has n't notice that led me , and we are thinner and you’re going to .
what it 's so then ?
the diet ?
and also there 's the ai very great study of the united states .
also the have the problem with obesity .
and they have in the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they wanted to quickly after watching , so what happens really ?
and they 've seen , the people take actually always be less fat on , but the people take anything that are fewer calories on to , but nevertheless , always and along .
and this was a paradox .
and so , you have it <unk> called .
we can this for us ?
because they have to do these the body as a power to imagine .
because we have here , so , ai big <unk> .
and on the one side of it 's a <unk> , there , we do the whole <unk> on it , the be here is burned .
and here is the energy <unk> when electricity .
if we now , however , more <unk> here we went in giving in our power station , when we 're going to the other side that use <unk> wondering , the energy in power station , and it makes it took off .
the human body does n't in just took off .
the can the energy to store .
and that is , in the form of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , however , if we are fewer such as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> wondering , here the energy and then makes it just a conclusion to .
the <unk> which , to drastically reduces .
here 's held in hell no life , more than go .
we 're yes , only still having mobile .
and this is this happens .
our grandparents are <unk> still after two miles to walk fluke .
and we come today i 've been on once on a to two miles and these are the positive and do it .
there 's trials , the report of five -- until <unk> feet .
i <unk> ' you this is still a <unk> with my friend mike , telling .

mike , you 're likely , you have degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
he 's really shy , he will not much to talk .
and he was then joined in this study with you , and sitting now here .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> , jeans <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in my hand .
and mike eat less and and less and and takes only still <unk> , and yet he will and over and along .
why ?
because it 's mike 's only still sitting .

and there stood on it a thousand steps .
that was so the distance , that mike <unk> has the morning , from the kitchen to the car with the car into the office there course , a bit of coffee and find out and night coming back .
and he came on a thousand steps .
that means that mike was clinging to that day , 10 minutes on his legs .
<unk> hours and fifty minutes , sitting mike , or whatever was mike .
under those conditions that makes a disease of alone .
and mike 's going to do n't therefore , dick , because he to be much eating , because so long as it up again and energy <unk> this , but not waste of he will inevitably must always thicker , and the energy <unk> to go .
and the first <unk> wondering , the energy , as you see here to modify its <unk> .
but energy is <unk> , the organism is not there .
the <unk> wondering , eventually got back in <unk> blood .
and also there is they 're actively and <unk> still , and quiet , to modify its <unk> .
so the blood sugar .

and this blood sugar , the <unk> there 's like <unk> , does all over the little black holes in this <unk> .
and a lucky , floating in there are still at the big fat , moving around and that up against the road , well over these little wounds and we speak of <unk> or <unk> .
and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because now it needs to the blood flows through these tight <unk> pots pumps and we talk from high blood .
and if this high blood and then on the like a <unk> true , then makes a 's also in the body took off .
and if this at the heart was happening , then we call the heart attack .
and if that in mind that happens then we call the stroke .
and also in germany , and dies every second chance , heart attack and the stroke .
that go in germany , and dies every second chance , <unk> .
and also mike 's going so not why sick , because he does n't like sports is driving , but because he was wondering , does n't even more moved .
and if you this kind of what 's not know them , then you look for you always come out , in the wrong .
the example , during the subject of diet .
i did the degrees ' , who was still time a diet -- in the amazon , just being and get there environment , and <unk> <unk> <unk> , currently .
and if each book so just a centimeter , dick 's and we would the here <unk> , we would have a 30 kilometers , up to tower , the current <unk> <unk> .
and i quit the time for you read all .
and there it inside and now that 's really important if you more energy goes in so more food as they consume and then you will be thick .
and if you less energy goes in when they consume and then you will be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why , we need to stop the environment , and books ?
that makes just a conclusion to .
that need of course , is huge , but <unk> is this did n't help .
because why it fails of diet , to a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet is , and not a lifestyle .
what they gain from the moment with a , we got this time , three weeks to make and here times five weeks , if we do , we aspire to this struggle , again in the normal life is that comes back , and to our normal life around .
what 's left , then actually , after five or seven weeks ago ?
nothing .
except <unk> and again a <unk> in the confidence that we keep up again , not that they 've done , what we went back as adults .
so they have to do these ab now , unlike any new diet , we looked at any new <unk> ask you can and you want to that in their day-to-day , in your lifestyle , integrate .
yes or no ?
and if yes , then go of .
and if no , you make it just stay .
because if the end , do n't come out , it 's pure of time . .
it are the habits that this , they decide whether we 're sick to , or a healthy , by .
it are the bad habits , the us to get sick to do .
and it are the good habits , the us healthy , do .
and if mike , in the mirror at you , then he look there , the result of his daily lifestyle .
if mike , in the mirror , look , then he look there , his daily habits .
and if mike , in the mirror at you , and honest , to be wondering , is , then he look as well , where it 's our way is .
because when he 's more bad habits , as good bread , then it 's just showed me into the disease , the way .
and if mike , in the direction to keep the direction , like this direction of its goals , the direction of its dreams , then it needs to do n't immediately be whole life <unk> .
then he need to just more good habits , as bad .
and a , <unk> habits , mike 's also a great , and one example of that the person has already a weird animal is .
mike , it has the example , did , movement has completely from his life is that <unk> by he every way with the car , which goes every <unk> uses , every lift , using .
and night , sitting he <unk> on the couch and to somehow <unk> again , next movement to come .
so he sits down , he was wondering , in his <unk> which goes into the gym there with the <unk> after the top of what yes , by definition se is already paradox is , and will then how much like this ai rat , again on the like a band <unk> , so that he somehow , again , next movement is coming .
and my grandpa , i 'd be wondering , so just <unk> as you .
the was a farmer and the would have that did n't understand .
the have said , sport is for people that , it’s not move .
and somehow has he also , right .
why we need to night in our most precious and play always that it provides what we in their daily in shock of ?
for somebody took think we have today lies in this <unk> lifestyle , two hours of sports and make a day .
and ted if only a 's , but very much easier to the movement , again , there to find where we do you lose .
in everyday life .
and so , <unk> ' i do you today to a different perspective , invite you .
maybe you know , they also the situation , you drive the evening , still time quickly , for shop , and following the turns out , in the front row — no way for free is .
and that showed you see how well , there will , this <unk> in us is .
we want to always the shortest because of go .
we plan our apartments and so that we the <unk> ways to have .
we plan our whole lives so that we keep the <unk> ways to have , but that brings us , but we do n't get there , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
why they have to them . ab now the <unk> activate and the movement , again , there are finding , where they 've been on show up .
i check your ' , for happy to the track .
and i 'm the only , the always end up and down and up and down on tv and everybody else to stand .
but if i , but we 've been a time , because i 'm then <unk> ' i now , but the time for me .
then <unk> ' i now , but the movement , a shift , there 's just like that are all the survival .
and if of up the <unk> comes to 30 minutes <unk> , , tell ' i <unk> .
environment , and steps .
that are about three times 10 minutes of translation .
and a , <unk> environment , and steps , if you go from here today , every day environment , and steps more to go then , that means you to go out for the day , twelve gram of fat , not in your body <unk> .
this may also be relatively little sound .
but when <unk> , as a habit of saying , time <unk> days in the year , then we talk from four point five pounds of fat .
that we 're not in our bodies have .
and you give me degrees ' time these , i <unk> ' watch it always <unk> .
the americans are yes crazy , the put so what here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
are , get ' i four pounds .
just so you time you see , what happened there with these little baby steps .
and if that the effect is coming from this in perspective , what my you , what happened just happened , if you really in a phenomenally active life to start .
and these <unk> the things out , you want . ab : today , every day in their day-to-day .
once you know , in <unk> steps per day , which makes you 're going to walk you virtually everybody 's prevalent of them .
and if you then they feel like , and have time on the sports and then they doing the eyes on the top .
then they have the next to the <unk> also still <unk> .
then you will also still too , and stronger .
but it 's how do you your health , not more dependent on of sports .
so they do you your health , not more dependent on some of their like it , and of their time .
because the critical that most important that they doing now , every day as a lifestyle .
and i <unk> ' a active life around <unk> .
and for me is it has gotten more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> that on a clear that decision is based for the lives and for me itself .
because i think , health has not to do with , what we should do , or do have to be .
but health has to do with , what we do want .
and so , <unk> ' i now only still an idea for them .
you decide to start to go from here today just hold still for the best .
and ab now you can also how it goes .
step for step .
very much , thanks .
<unk> now , how it 's a leonardo , there , da vinci , actually managed to what 's like this incredible , <unk> way , and the way the world with others ' eyes to see ?
and starts to itself so far on that engage in what to his time just which simply inconceivable , never thought was ?
we could that , and also now ?
did that maybe what with companies , to do ?
and how we can use it to force and confidence for our future draw ?
we start , but the time , everything else with the question what we understand really under the innovation ?
i realized .
technology invention of research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government has the title <unk> the federal government .
so you know about me , right .
this is yes , all great .

that we do with a so extraordinary , unique , wealth 've developed .
but like it looks with the future of ?
which the challenges that come because there as a society based on us to ?
and who cares about laughing , because there to the large environmental groups and social challenges ?
so <unk> ' it seemed kind mattered to be .
of the kind of labor .
so the economy of sticks , hard to take the an environmental challenges , because the entrepreneurs and then the big effort with the we then productivity and efficiency rapidly .
and the at the world better want to make the find the road , in the nonprofit organizations and bring together and <unk> and the need to then also what companies , so basically all <unk> course , to try and then the damage the term capitalist in the economy to remove themselves .
at least , very complex to fix .
but who says , because that we looked at the than that , separated at need to ?
how would it because if we our <unk> to make sure ai social and cultural dimension to expand this ?
if technological innovation , simultaneously , whatever cultural innovation are ?
if the economic innovations and the same as well , social innovation are ?
if it gives us even further leaders , thinking and doing sent to self-assemble with the solution , very large environmental and and social engineering challenges ?
if it becomes very different far , unknown forces <unk> and if it gives us even further a very different , and fair <unk> of how to promote ?
because as i was that ?
both sides were trying to help but what companies , right ?
can we do it ?
ask , you may was a woman .
so far we have that yes , and bigger than to deal with the way our .
fortunately , there 's not your encouraging examples .
muhammad yunus , has with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh is incredibly much does the order to the poverty , there <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more just in direct <unk> to the the , what the government schools <unk> done a crime .
and he has <unk> as entrepreneurs , probably only begun to make for the nobel <unk> get .
it at the opportunity because of making me a i <unk> ' they still with anyone familiar to do .
from now , can i imagine <unk> <unk> .
'n very <unk> young guy .

and yes , so totally <unk> .
i love the totally happy to .
and if you can to see , then you think , oh , real , of what the offspring , there , we need to us to define our future , yes n't worry about doing .
yes , right after the the studying did he then , somewhere here 's begun to work held in our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
this is he also very good .
that they like him , totally and maybe there 's also very successful .
and yet , anything you would be there 's there are still so in him .
so he , asks is n't there may be more , that kind in me would be there ?
so this the entrepreneurial , he says , then always .
companies , are yes , in spite of <unk> .
and that they like him as well .
and he would have fallen as well this <unk> .
so the right there 's also the <unk> , the did he is in the same recognized .
so not that he told him in order for us know , but so from <unk> tells him the vagina , what .
and there was in the middle class in the t , three n the knew he did n't .
so we also you cut more was he surprised when the him , then the can <unk> personally was introduced .
when mister <unk> .
and as 'n experienced the entrepreneurs who has he was wondering , then there 'd imagined .
the the janitor 's great pleasure preparing for , so with young people work together , there , he presents his experience i feel the .
and the two have then challenged by other people , found .
and have , makes more than once met .
how would it because if we just over time , so in a lot of these conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes , mister <unk> , so how was that because again , right .
what is now , exactly the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> by -- company ?
that i 've still not so very understood .
yes , so , <unk> then we start , but the time , does it at the question what 's 'n <unk> company ?
so the name says , and so , yes , already .
established markets , established products , established customers , established structures , there 's a no history .
and you can also pretty much exactly the quest . ab : give , where the road , the big a single one is causing .
and time , ai ai <unk> , even when the very neat is can that 's also go down .
what 's because then actually a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you 've <unk> already so one of it 's time , guaranteed to do n't it 's exactly what 's not the small copy of a big company .
it 's something very different .
it has yes , a completely other character .

not by -- customers , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
of that 's why is a <unk> a temporary organization that the the purpose to serve a business to seek to find , to develop the impact of this is , of course , they said , but i do so , <unk> is , and wondering , and smaller scale it 's brainwaves .
and you 're going certainly understand that it is obviously in so <unk> organization , very different very different kind of thinking there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yes , that 's me already be clear .
but after what we look for because actually ?

so i cried . ' there 's also a degree , that fits very well , so 'n seminar i found in berlin , `` would you me that would recommend it ?
that means <unk> .
how do you , your companies to succeed <unk> and after the <unk> , your life for <unk> talk about it .
oh no .
but really <unk> ?
what you believe , you , because if you do with the beginning , 30 kilometers , get your <unk> money does n't talk about what 's because after your <unk> ?

what if you with what your commitment , so how i know you ?
and also , we can look , but the time the <unk> matters .
so the statistics about <unk> give you notice no <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of all <unk> are few years has been done after in a lot worse , financial situation when i 'm in your big , go .
money is always the outcome of a successful company , and of a good and it turned the company .
i realized , money is an energy source for an enterprise actions .
and it the foundation all economic <unk> .
but it 's never the goal of companies .
yes , which is then the goal ?
with the computer company ?
so , i guess what `` get ' i cried . ' yet , learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , these goals to guess , but she comes and then and measurable through time when you are going to be and so forth .

so that makes me , no longer feel good .
so how do i because there to decide , and and risks to go into this feels like incarceration , for me all this and vague , and inherently matters .
yes , <unk> welcome in the enterprise .
but i cried . ' there may what for you .
a thread .
so the is yes , already <unk> , so almost 've been a secret .
and on the <unk> of generation to generation <unk> .
a <unk> for instincts .
so , or how to say , you today ?
<unk> , get ' i , <unk> ?

in case for all the crises and <unk> and <unk> sustainable uncertainty .
so that it is guaranteed .
i think i made ' , i can see you to one of contexts .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
but it 's where the yes , just ask them on it .
that you can , you from the same time i 'll notice one of the basis of enterprise qualities , is good questions to imagine .
we in the time a after the other to go through that i do that perhaps better understand it ?
so the first one is what am i am here and what i want , i 'm here will do ?
yes , <unk> , there 's hear <unk> what moves you , that about you move beyond that in the greater is when you make ourselves ?
what <unk> you going on the world ?
what have the people of them , if you with you work together ?
what are you ready to give them ?
what are your inner , perhaps god , you also become unconscious <unk> ?
why is that so important that to see it ?
because that are also your business enterprise <unk> .
and how we do this of learn ?
if you 've got a ship to build you want to then <unk> not the men together bits of work a hot , they hold of wood to collect , but i teach them , yearning for the line is roughly , an infinite , the ocean .
yes , well .
so then you look over i time to me the next one of questions .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what that mean , because it ?
yes , <unk> now think you can leave your goal really time <unk> .
colorful <unk> in detail , colorful , but i <unk> ' you , right after a paradox , if you went <unk> , what does n't you want to do then it will respond to see you hang them stay .

it falls to me because the degree of a .
not ?
<unk> .
so , pass time on .
reset it tells you time , not a pink and elephants ago .
okay ?
it work a 's already ?
so , not a pink and elephants .
understand ?
no pink and elephants .
look so you ?
so let 's hear us , if we were so on it focused on this , what we do n't want .
what is there 's actually the only way ?
because it occurred <unk> ?
yes , clear , displace . ' you notice that ago , about what you want to do .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the baby pandas on the <unk> .
but you get through a 's telling you visualize ago .
the way , what , i just can think of you 've <unk> yet <unk> or ?
i cried . ' you so there a brought .
look over time to see if you the <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> war room <unk> lord smith .
and who ?
at & <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> what <unk> <unk> to cradle <unk> matter with a , <unk> <unk> .

i of <unk> [ the glass of working in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
lo and i of what <unk> my carroça <unk> working in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady , smith .
oh , ♫ but you ♫ but <unk> <unk> buy you <unk> ?

<unk> ago . <unk> .

[ the real <unk> is that they <unk> <unk> <unk> buy you ?
and <unk> look like a 's from ?
is you so what i noticed ?
which , say anything changes ?
okay .
okay , and the flower , too .
okay .
so , and then we can look , but the time , then we can look time where the bear with that , is .
lo and action .
<unk> <unk> in <unk> war room <unk> lord smith .
and who ?
at & <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> what <unk> <unk> to cradle <unk> matter with a , <unk> <unk> .

i of <unk> [ the glass of working in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
lo and i of what <unk> my carroça <unk> working in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady , smith .
and <unk> , as it 's hear from you with it ?
so , i know , still , i was also be shocked .
i was actually really shocked .

i thought it ca : yes , probably not was be .
and still much more shocking , i was as me through the head off to is , it might be that i actually the sort of this way through the area , over ?
by my life .
and okay , i understand , yes , the power , yes , totally different sense .
to wake up there , the immediate <unk> to prevent that we the most of all of our perception and our <unk> undercover <unk> have to .
but what comes , because now actually to ?
what <unk> ' i was and what <unk> ' i from ?
and therefore <unk> , among you through your perception and specifically , somewhere <unk> to capture , is an ai for another important entrepreneurial quality .
well , yes , thanks , then we come , but the time to the next question .
how could i really have to my goal to come ?
so , i find that ai good question .
that <unk> ' i dress which is that every time as well , and i know that somehow not on going forward .
yes , <unk> , because there 's it ai good news for you .
that 's going to you so much easier into harm than you that maybe i 've never knew what talk about it .
because if you through your what matters is clear , as your inner drive and if you went 'n <unk> goal became very rough presented so what did i promise you , in is it going back inside of happen by .
almost automatically .
you 're going n't even the way you can than that a brainstorming , in front of you the brain is that things on all you are kind .
that are then these famous <unk> , the , you get up underneath the shower , so what did .
and still ai question i recommend it tells you want to see the spot look , you , well , to look , who you do you have them could talk about who are you the career advice questions could talk to find there more input , more at one with every home to get .
and all you also a huge role model .
the <unk> have the very well , <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , if the not more on , i knew , has the in his <unk> invited back in florence .
to lunch , among the famous big table .
and it 's this totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , a banker , act as engineers , architects and he has an ai very intense <unk> cared for .
but not in our modern day senses , where a 's drum went , yes , who she sits down , largely through ?
who has been right ?
but rather , and one that suddenly , from these different kinds <unk> things forward from the people are so on no one way , and the way of a million of their own , i 'd be wondering , i can come can .
well , yes , the next question is what 's what good concrete next step i do it ?
<unk> there are doing , it’s a 's successful entrepreneur in the reason that simple .
instead of the big to conceive , and management and so on focus on them , makes just going on the next step .
because what you going to because in the area of uncertainty is also do ?
but the lead those very determined and with all of the consequence of .


it 's why it 's so important that you through your destiny ? what 's clear .
that there you from the inside of security .
and making the how we actually have all we go to learn ?
although we that yes n't even knew , and it also , nobody has said ?
-- questions , says , you there 's also <unk> in her children .
so , this playful and learn that is a search and this <unk> playful and look for it 's also , the fun makes that in a company is actually happening in a <unk> .
and that 's also , just like , you that <unk> against the uncertainty , the us what else is always been so anxious power .
yes , thanks ! mister <unk> .
so that sounds of water , yes , already very great wall of .
but i do n't know so , in trying to me in the company , i think i made ' there must naturally , still a lot of bosses change that there anything you happen .
and ourselves over me here in germany , there 's always been so this gives the mood .
and i think i made ' , there would have to the politicians , undercover as to worry that its standard , to change .
okay my boy , come from the time with .
how to go here time , down , come to the water .
what you think that you think , how many people can you change ?
10 ?
10 thousand ?
ten million ?
look , the time here , down .
who you look so you ?
alright , the .
this is the nobel prize , you change that you can expect to do you really change that you can .
or to throw it with mahatma gandhi to say , looking for the change shift , you 're interested in the world were looking in front of you yourself .
you think was safe , beautiful words and big models , but how is it ? because it were going to work ?
because we have fortunately , still 'n few <unk> on our <unk> .
helpful in all sorts <unk> of crises , or a while you to small , you feel for something or if you make a <unk> <unk> and they 've all with you to do .
and if you fall in such situations , wondering what you see you see you now despite all this to <unk> ' you , which posture , you occupy that you can physically , according to see you really powerful to feel .
<unk> ' you , but in time , what you so what happens to <unk> they like , the user , do you just <unk> .
and very finally , , <unk> ' all you , what you 're actually sort of this crisis , or at the fact , what 's bad happened is because i talk about it .
so i do for , if it 's it tells you already happening is , the road , and so , at least worth it has .
yeah well .
mister <unk> thank you .
and you believe , you really going to give me that helps on my enterprise way ?
yes , right .
and i 'd make it tells you do so , two things .
and the first time the expression on the clarity and yours go inside <unk> me , and then to do your hugely to do what will .
because that determines your perception .
and to the second one i on your inner attitude to you , even consider to .
because it 's how <unk> , you like the other people wondering , you from us to the behavior .
the future of thousands , always just then when we our own perception to change .
<unk> you have got this to ?
yes , i think twice ' already .
thanks ! mister <unk> well then .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what we think they of our <unk> ?
nice .
really , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold a 's because now actually with this <unk> ?
like this is a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
that very much .

<unk> means you can breathe stressed .
and this is that , what the <unk> really is like .
a <unk> from potions for the euphoria .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
this is now , but the <unk> .
the right now in our country has already have just in the big , famous one on <unk> .
from robert bosch , over <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or how they all the hot .
let us , but very simple that spirit can try to animate them .
and who knows , maybe is yes , from our <unk> the next leonardo in our time .
you see the right , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would be so <unk> , that i spoke with kids and their future of the kind because finally , are yes , kids , our future .
instead is that the way or the i the most of time i enjoy .
i spend a majority of my life in prison .
four years ago , have my father and i was the program <unk> , entrepreneurship , for prisoners , who started .
we could qualify <unk> entrepreneurial , that means you can range , after the custody , either on their own do or find after their was ever be easier to a work , to the they then also can hold .
why <unk> i 'm really well , so it so if to <unk> , so the ones who already had failed are the big mistake i 've done ?
our program is a much not as easy to understand how programs that . they can transform the kids who care .
and honest , had said , i thought , that the <unk> the last place in the universe is , in the side , i work would .
what you think , is the most important piece missing a factor in the childhood , with the people with that we work ?
we 've learned , it are positive models of times , male positive models .
and if you think about , why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> there are often it 's because it . that that the father 's no sensible work has that he , '' -- that he 's drugs -- which is , or he said to yourself in prison is up .
and if then a seven-year-old boy , i think about what he from his life like to make it has he might do n't actually better idea , as a different lives might look , because he was no better models of mind .
and he <unk> his father , wait .
i <unk> ' you , martin , imagine .
martin 's <unk> of our program .
his father was an alcoholic and made the whole family that live in the hell .
when he was 12 was is his mother died , and he and be a little baby brother who had to engage in every home .
there was he the <unk> the great .
he was shy and <unk> and identify the perfect victims .
the way to the the day , you might be a little baby brother 's true of the game , so roughly <unk> been is that this was the bottom , who are we stayed .
and there was burned in places that martin 's the first time the <unk> through , he went on the enemy off and proposed to .
and imagination . that day , he was respects .
and it went from it .
violence was part of well , next to his life is exactly the same for his father .

after the childhood , after the youth who are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
you know , not much different than your illegal activities and their <unk> the perception .
and then you will be one day with people in jail is closed organizations that 's exactly like that goes , and in their thoughts of them to the same thing it `` the same time , no better models are .
about what , you think , think these people together , after , if you put together in prison , which are ?
mostly about not much good .
and they 're getting better criminal justice in <unk> .
they sell then have drugs on a higher level and plan , still in the custody , where you to see the custody <unk> could .
and this thing is then in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
that go in germany will everyone on her second criminals <unk> .
then there 's but also people in prison , the road , really change want .
but also , these people wear a rubber on the forehead .
and there 's standing <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is that your first identity .

this is the problem , the brink of we are .
how we 're trying to this problem to solve ?
what kind of creatures , you think , bring a lot of <unk> with ?
they will be surprised .
it are more entrepreneurial skills .
who have a <unk> been building has seen definitely no idea of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
the only places in the subject <unk> has a 's a little <unk> , otherwise , if only ' he 's not in prison , did .
these characteristics we want you 're looking for something good use .
we start our program with a <unk> education in prison , in three <unk> .
we 're going to convey the really kind of of entrepreneurship and the economy .
each of the participants write its own <unk> and everybody who takes hold of a comprehensive <unk> part .
and then to be with we the people also to see the custody at the phone <unk> , it at the <unk> it at the strengthening of your personal relations and also working at a bag of <unk> .
what for <unk> go there from our program , and out ?
it 's a big , bandwidth , from <unk> to the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> it is the <unk> .

<unk> leaders , talent and his illusion , from the rapid money you 've got it already very early on to trade with some of their seduced .
he had always been fun . that , businesses to run .
he 's then <unk> to the first time , arrested been .
and that into custody , has it not just very impressed me .
very in the opposite .
he says , which i do today , he 've gone back then his second custody for the future .
<unk> is he then to the second time and sentenced to have been .
he took then only a wall of therapy part and then at the <unk> .
and there i learned when he 'd like he would be the leaders , talent for something <unk> can use .

the agency 's how i thought it , he can now being shot of life .
he which , very good <unk> of the design .
he 's now here with me .
who told him , like to know each other to talk you want it matters .
still time back to martin , any of the i told him to begin with that tells you had .
martin , has been , his childhood a training to the point at you leave and ended up in his time , in in the <unk> <unk> .
and because alcohol , and drugs , there , among the agenda are was be a cycle , quite quickly we launched .
he worked out all over a dj , and as <unk> .
twenty years , led he took this life .

one day injured , he who wants to about a <unk> so hard that he then he convicted of grass .
he took at the <unk> part and that <unk> there has really be life changed .
he learned , he was like to more force to more success and to more quality could come without his <unk> to strive for or without drugs to consume .
and he was from his knowledge , so excited that he had decided that i 'd like to he likes to pass .
and he wanted part of the <unk> be .
that has was [ unclear ] .
he works for now so close to two years , unlike us and <unk> our main collaborator on its way to me into the freedom , because he knows ourselves that , if you , it’s really change want , and if you have the right tools with the day of your hand , get that much more possible is when you often find my want .
the basis of these successes are the way people as you .
people , the with us in jail get the to external events , with us to come to cut our participants once in their <unk> over , your personal plans to consult .
that are our <unk> , the <unk> talks in our lessons really think , that are students at the <unk> do , <unk> the <unk> to make change .
and that are our mentors , the our participants in the best thing to the custody to be with .
and also these people take a very much of our program with .
one example .
we do on our events , an exercise , the road , <unk> called .
we stick and then in the middle of making room and a big <unk> our participants stand on the a and our an environment stand on the other side .
and i 'm making then , different questions .
and every time , if anyone in space that question with yes , you answer to kick he appeal to the line ago .
and here shows , it turns out what we all together we have , whether we within the this prison sit or outside .
but also , where the differences are up .
and a example of that , where the differences are up , is the following question .
i 'm in a so-called social focal grew up , or i had a family member of what already , once in custody of self .
because when we are usually very many of our participants in front of hit the line and just very few days of an environment .
a question , that i 'd like to now , the us all connecting , the <unk> ' i 'd like you imagine .
notice that i urge you that they all even get up .
maybe we can be a little light get in the audience .
i can you see .
it on us all .
terrific .
thank you .
i get through ' you now a question , and if you that question with yes , you 're trying to put them , they 've got back to myself , otherwise would remain they just stand .
this is , so to our our line , that we now i draw .
i have in my life of getting things done , for the i 'd punished , can be was it , but not .
if you that question with yes , you 're trying to put them to start to please .
that to count , drunk car , now they measure .
that to count , perhaps , too low doses of large 're going into obsessed me to have .
that to count , it with the seat , not very , just taken to have .
okay .
and it counts as well , and one , perhaps , any workforce , not always very accurate up for have them .
all right .
most of the seats .
we have a few angel in space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you , they must naturally , all over again , sit down .
looked at this question , if we the on the events , imagine , get our an environment very often comes into me thinking .
and many will also clear , how much broader happiness , you might be kind of view .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment , in the they were growing up , with the friends , but also very lucky , man , that you may not always have , and hits been are if you something on the edge of the <unk> or also about beyond what did .
what are the results of our work ?
sixties percent of our alumni of finding out from within <unk> days after their was ever a workplace .
this is at a very quickly .
<unk> percent have , it’s already this is something done .
a third of the donor cycles in the past year we were <unk> .
and our <unk> 's sitting at over seven percent .
i did it already told the <unk> of seven percent is , as a <unk> in germany , of <unk> percent of us to .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> a year , the taxpayers <unk> euros .
and it 's a pretty <unk> , <unk> , what a <unk> of seven percent of us to a <unk> of typically <unk> percent for a <unk> means .
when my father and i put together in the <unk> founded have , are we open to the first group of quite many for quite nuts , that i 'd been .
i cried since then my . one <unk> in a big businesses , given up .
but i must tell you , i picked up in my life is still not as a <unk> the work .
we encourage our participants that says , responsibility to take over .
responsibility , what in your life 's happened , and do so , responsibility for to wrestle , what in their lives will happen .
, it’s not to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a very new consumer confidence and then that 's also have the number , again , trust to build .
and therefore it makes me very , especially happy and pride , when our participants , frankly , of their way to report .
this one -- i put them a little video , brought .
film go down .
so i was convicted to two years , and eight months , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was because of <unk> against the <unk> to three years , and 10 months convicted .
i with you 're going into traded .
so , i judgment of two years getting because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of the question <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> which , actually my complete life changed .
and what for me was important , was this <unk> , the also made .
because there was my yes , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , <unk> ' i almost to say , yeah .
i picked up again targets long ago eyes tip .
i picked up again , perspective of self . i 've got back to jump forward to which .
and you goes with a very other minds and consciousness from the custody out .

with the wrong people together and this now not anymore .
well , it the problem is that many no assistance systems have , if that emerge .
that the biggest problem , because then it 's automatically feeling a lot , that you go back in the old , faculty will come .
you know them , yes , nothing else .
by this <unk> delivered <unk> , whatever , what 's where everything was offered is business , stick with me just my whole way you think about me putting yourself , about other , the user 's interacting with problems , the user 's interacting with the society , the business , stick with me just during this after two weeks , completely was shot .
i 'm going on for <unk> of my first woman : divorce .
and been happening internationally , six months . bye . ' i went back with her together .
so that means , we have a new relationship started .


i 'm with my family back in plain the education started .
so i work today in my <unk> , <unk> ' i say .
i do what ' was just a <unk> to the <unk> .
you have to that actually acknowledge that it is very , many people there are the fact , like for example , my mentor , also now , about this time still looking out and actually about to be yes , i do n't know , <unk> engagement , beyond the people to support .
i 'm grateful for that you to do with the idea at all come are you to be so what do .
i 'm grateful for that you to do it , despite with safety of difficulty was pulled have and i 'm extremely grateful , that i would be part of all for .
that to member of course also all the people , the support , the way and were .
i picked up as i said , with many people died in the events , talked , and the me again and confirmed have this is good , that do what ' .
and for that 'll figure ' i a 's also do .
and for it , tell ' i thank you .
they come with us in jail .
each of you has something , what we need to , it .
if you know , our participants once in their <unk> , which are , if you know when the <unk> to come from us whether they in the frame of a financial support the way and this is .
if you know , our program in a new <unk> carry those cases , very <unk> issue .
talk you us , please come in .

and excited to us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i 've gone from in <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a time in the i do something that way . was .
because you make yes , things like .
the road , for <unk> apply them .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the monastery , take .
there 's yes , today really are many ways as you with <unk> deal with fractals .
specifically as you <unk> deal with fractals .
anyway , i was <unk> also that way . .
with my work and so 'n bit with the <unk> .
which that i 'm here 's really of <unk> talk to worry .
and not from real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and i could tell me , quite right <unk> like my life in a decade after two , about 30 years will look .
it was <unk> .
and this predictability i thought was very scary .
so to it at least , express .

for the city as private .
i knew just do n't expect me to the <unk> way to continue ?
but do it to me just lazy way ?
or what if i mean <unk> again a new , throw this ?
and look , ' and then what happens .
what then on me wait .
that were so the thoughts .
i was in this time , free <unk> so in a day 's .
as i said <unk> .
the <unk> for me was also , despite <unk> the absolute <unk> .
you fluently , free the world 's living in very good hotels and write fluently , the country on a very <unk> way , and the way .
fluently , but these surveys , too <unk> countries .
the developing countries where it sure anymore to see , and tell us there than about a quaint villages , with kind . <unk> people for the fact that they have nothing , so about happiness and joy of broadcast .
what a lot of these images and to cliché about living , but a <unk> kind of the cars .
and that 's what was for me after a while the crux of .
i was just that what i did to little bit .
and turn on its face .
furthermore , i found it 's a little <unk> of me about a country to write to judge that i really did n't get really know there .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to countries , right by seeing .
so to <unk> article was writing code .
and if to my personal interest to be breastfeeding .
how you learn countries are better know ?
by showing you with the people who lives .
what in the people who lives , on you home .
not in the hotel .
by showing you 're going to start with the challenges and with the problems of the people engaged .
and so as you with the people who works .
at least that was the answer , i went to me on this question to give you could .
and that i wanted to do .
furthermore , i wanted something worthy do .
i wanted a contribution to afford .
something to do good .
and this sense of business , in trying to me to do so , so in a <unk> further . it increases .
i was that is , she 'd already too often in developing countries , but in nepal , has me just a particularly touched .
until <unk> was for there 's a 10 year-old civil war in the not just numbers of orphans , but also lots economic and social problems and left .
with an annual income , of <unk> dollars , is nepal , the poorest country in asia .
and counting to continue to a the two decades , the poorest countries in the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the population suffer from the types of malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult can do n't read and write .

in the i even something to change wanted .
and drum , go up after my return of nepal , my decision areas .
i quit my job .
and <unk> me is what the aid .
and i <unk> ' now , this short , a excerpt from the answer <unk> that i on my job application received .
because they just a defining who was .
it 's about here to find a serious amazed by looking at <unk> international generated by businesses .

hi ?
let 's hear about locally ?
my job application was really seriously , what being and good .
at least i thought that .
and that answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really do unplug .

and fortunately , never <unk> .

i it used as an engine which to my own company to reasons .
<unk> .
's heart labeled lo and soul and <unk> .
a company that in basically exactly that offers , what i then , looking for you have more .
which is the possibility , a country unlike to traveling .
the possibility , a country right to meet .
by i do with the people in front of place to live and can work .
and , they do n't go somewhere can work , but in <unk> <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in the two words , though .
so karma , and <unk> .
that , and so much , like a place , looking at the fact , you good karma collect more you .
( in the the you do good can .
this sounds now 'n little bit <unk> .
it 's but not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use the tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
specifically what we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .
because the people , the with us to travel to afford , during <unk> very useful volunteering .
they pay for their journey , as true of the other organizers .
but they travel , it works differently .
you live in her <unk> .
and the objective is n't care as much the recovery or care as much <unk> but for attempting <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and we broaden our .
that to engage an alien , our participants , ever been , qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work , for a gentle tourism , in areas to encourage the otherwise , no chance on the classic tourism that would have .
because just the necessary to infrastructure that we were missing .
to the other , we can sustainable projects to encourage them .
we can reduce their sustainable projects <unk> and finance .
we pay for us so to a hundred percent of itself .
are also not on giving wheelchair-bound .

start , we have with our work <unk> in nepal .
<unk> year we have our engagement , on uganda expanding .
and now after about four years turned to start to us by now i got married and my husband and i are also do for a team , a <unk> question .
we go the <unk> way to continue ?
or what if we still hold greater than thinking ?
if we the <unk> still continues to sum up ?
if we do with the development not just a social engagement and sustainable travel to my but the development in his wholeness that , and ?
and those are also the individual <unk> have them ?
or it , a specialty , kind <unk> .
that would then in basically a new one extra company .
a company , that by , businesses , but then .
with other <unk> but the same philosophy , like <unk> .
we want that ?
i was the next question .
'n new software company ?
sure that we want that .
we love the entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we buy a ticking .
because we the same language to talk .
because we the same dreams , and dreams .
because we the challenges to understand .
and why we 've year in <unk> a nurse , given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> promote , we 're creative companies in of development and <unk> <unk> that we by really extraordinary people to support .

so <unk> the the personal social and <unk> and many other pairs of <unk> include .
and <unk> the on the <unk> prepare .
the there it at <unk> also again .
a tour of the next to a meaningful <unk> still one more huge advantage from .
he shows a in relatively short time on where you think there is , or where you <unk> .
where you may still <unk> prior to produce .
where you might want to a bit more flexible , is , to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a on , at , you really good is .
when there is a his strengths in front of eyes .
those that 's the creativity , the sudden it , a great sex is .
or those that 's the serenity that you can try to in , they 've discovered .
the serenity and things just assume that you do n't we can change .
and the power , things to change shift , you can change .
and you can be very much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
a example , and one .
that are <unk> rose <unk> , named lydia and <unk> .
that are five very wonderful women from uganda .
with <unk> non-zero-sumness and with a talent .
they winds , beautiful , deserved <unk> been years .
and since the years on is nothing .
because they simply no market for had .
because they do n't even know , as you the quality can improve .
because you nobody has said , which design may be in the question is coming .
we wanted to these women help .
and have therefore the year in also a <unk> set up .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
products that people of poverty , get .
that you a income to give them .
a future to occur .
we 're yesterday with our <unk> live gone .
and we start with a first move <unk> edition .
a <unk> edition of thousand <unk> of our women .
the sale , which brings them not just for a year after a guaranteed income .
but allows us as well , the project is still much larger to do .
this first edition , is sort of the social responsibility crowd <unk> and <unk> in a .
so who are going on want , can this one thing , with the purchase a chain of doing to the other , it could but with us , either directly into the project to travel .
he can be able to the women who travel , little action <unk> .
the long will we 're not only five women a work to give them , but fifty or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but also in nepal and in other <unk> , in which we <unk> work .
and offers is , but this <unk> just a project from our possibility , cycle of the best projects .
we 're working in all the central areas .
in the area <unk> <unk> lo and health , and <unk> lo and <unk> .
because the work in the only one area easy to do when it 's .
what happens with the kids when the women who work ?
right .
therefore we have in this year in nepal and in uganda , also have two <unk> centre , started .
all time , and in our own cycle on each other .
and looked at the power is still more sense , as any one project for yourself .
participants , we place where we 've ever been , qualification , in the various projects .
the grain of ways to what 's naturally , then always the only in the common good work .
and just wanted to i 'm so now , even directly on a journey to take them .
and that to please , i 'm so the eyes to restore .
reset ' into you ago , you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you been sitting there to a wooden dining room .
and where you 're happy , and tired of .
and you 've just with outside your <unk> to lunch eaten .

and see these kids in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet tumble the sand on .

how are always tell you like a with my hands and feet to talk .
later come still the other women on this .
they smile on you <unk> matters .

under the tree .
in the open .
unbelievable , that 's here yet the internet , there .
this morning <unk> you walk again with what your coach .
i thought that <unk> you fall .
the exchange is every time , valuable .
furthermore , it 's beautiful time again deutsch , to talk .
you 're hearing the music .
and that <unk> of <unk> .
mom <unk> washing in the courtyard , the pots off .
they sing and a african proverb that song .
, you are relaxed , and happy .
you 're doing the eyes , again on doing .
each of us can the <unk> to come to now , there something new engage in .
now , or for a short time that cube , again to turn to throw away .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i 'm starting to be one of interest me , whether of you tonight is a , they 're here , already time someone 'n ' house occupied by .
i just know , ' with the light , not that really well , but perhaps want to start to say a sign up .
down here , i just ' i hear somebody .
two .
here to jump up , i just ' i 'm sorry , not , but anyway , down here are already time two , that 's beautiful , we 're already time to <unk> .
i cried . ' see , you a building occupied and that is , the villa mountain in east , the city <unk> .
this is the building .

and so , <unk> ' i tonight is here from them .
well , and , like it now some of you might say .
, what is a 's also ?
<unk> there 's and yes , many .
but i want it for just a .
oh , what , her work up now the villa along ?
and her <unk> then in park or how ?
just a small group selection of the questions , the as we know , friends , colleagues have asked when you know you 've seen that i part of an initiative with the i whistle , ' to , something <unk> name , <unk> 'm .
all expected , that we will seamlessly in the series of the <unk> <unk> had .
and here today it comes to these villa <unk> been building prototypes did , <unk> to minimize and the banner on which had .
and to take advantage against the privatization of these villa out to protesting .
but who i who knows , you know that 's not mean , some of our <unk> .
and it was also not the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see here , is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , the one you privately is , and therefore , for many people do n't available to it says , <unk> ' i do n't say , but just might not in public hand is and will not so used can be about how to public spaces may make use .
we were a group of <unk> all together in the the desire , with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , sensitive and sustainable to deal .
and we wanted to a different <unk> tell .
we were a <unk> team and that i must now very quickly . detect , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , planning , social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , designs , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
of course , at also with different social and cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspectives <unk> and enriched to go .
and have us to take place , on different skills , but also on various networks <unk> .
and creative ways that part of unconventional solutions in the the <unk> , the we then , and did have , <unk> to realize .
we 've actually navigated to the villa out to occupy .
however , going to a 's us about the fact that we the villa with stories and ideas to occupy .
we 've been , memories and images being asked .
and from these memories and images from it 's trying to sorts of faith , for the villa out to develop .
and ted , it was telling us important that the process and you are constructive remains .
us as an initiative , even have we have , and she always as <unk> platform and as <unk> terms .
so i was <unk> a <unk> and emotional occupy and became an hour , and after to a <unk> .
on the experiences , that we have , and they 've done , <unk> ' i tonight is going to go .
every city has some <unk> places .
the a neighborhood a face to give them .
in many cases have been doing this , however <unk> and <unk> and be reflected in a result of citizens , as alien to places i noticed .
they are the deaths from places in a city because they just said often not for the equal , what we 're in a public space expect .
so for instance , that we <unk> have , <unk> have .
be this , but also the fact , public , the urban places from point , impact is often <unk> .
initiatives , that these places would actually want to stay in many cases also <unk> interest already in the infancy , into .
what has it also with me to do , like and here some questions , we like some outside of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places , giving our town , not just a face .
no .

so actually how we there are often the first <unk> <unk> to our neighbors , if we wanted to land on the way to the shopping to meet .

and we just might 'n , longer 'll fly into .
it turned out of creating friendships , sometimes .
but what 's certainly going to geometry that 's a feeling of community .

and when i think i 'm not <unk> , then it 's becoming one you that , what you probably the anonymity a big city called .
we stood then ago , two challenges .
we can help in the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for your neighborhood woken up or in <unk> also <unk> be .
how can protest in the creation be transformed ?
how can only criticism in the ideas to be transformed ?

imagine , you want now , that they sit here , even ago , they beat the newspaper on and read the following the text .
i love the zones , and citizens , we invite you a we want you three possible different forms for the redesigning the head <unk> imagine that have a before carefully <unk> <unk> designed .
they must be in the minimal level to the idea of a nuance , pick .
and the variation in with the most <unk> is then <unk> implemented .
they would go ahead ?
would anyone from them to this event , go ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds , first time a great .
it there ai possibility , what time it .
they ca <unk> , like that in the future looks .
and again , it sounds , first time a great , in the first moment .
i try to ' me still a wall of explanation .
and it 's this , because i the opinion , i 'm they ca n't look really not join or pick up or forever , <unk> .
one , because the classic <unk> often much to be late <unk> .
that is , mostly they have n't actually have a chance , really , your suggestions to make or basically the alternatives to discuss , but there 's actually been an ai , design and they ca <unk> still going to decide whether they <unk> or <unk> in the urban , green plants .
or , like a friend of other day said , what color the trash have the example .
second one explanation , classical <unk> ? is rarely spoke about information and vote on out .
if you see the day of three <unk> varieties .
we have is what , that we want to show you , and they must then you can vote .
frustration and incomprehension -- are often the consequences of what i also kind of an act , i find .
i certainly have to share with no choice about <unk> or <unk> meeting when i really rather ai <unk> way where instead <unk> <unk> 'd had had much .
it goes , but also different .
although we on the overcoming the we have on <unk> many , talking about this had bread , we have ultimately , much disturbed experience .
that , and we have about what 's picking up and that i want now for other <unk> share .
i want it too , to any other initiatives , at the other projects , but also , or do so , the day of <unk> and the day of politics .
because just looked at the ones who are , the ones that <unk> actually do -- should and the really responsible for these kinds of processes are .
if , which is really the interest in a wall of participation of sand , how it so often to struggle and points out is then we need them and then we need the who did a new <unk> .
ca n't last , <unk> ' i told me , but ends , they all that they do today , sit here .
and it 's this is why , because i <unk> for very important that i think .


so , we have to participation look like to pick somebody in the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for your neighborhood and they feel like to where involvement and <unk> to get stressed out ?
first about willingness for the dialogue box on playing field .
in <unk> meet the professionals , on a reporter , citizens on <unk> and different interests on each other .
what we see here , is a picnic sheet , to the the we invited to have .
what we see here , are some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation with citizens .
the goal must be used to make all these conversations on playing field on today , so that not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills , over the missing in the citizens are here .
the citizens in front of being there are experts , they 're experts , for your neighborhood , you know , what you missing , which <unk> you with a place to connect , in which one of tradition , a place it says , and also , what you ago , where the missing .
the <unk> , mostly it at the city can force as , what on <unk> level in the project into his supposed to .
in as different or in in a particular case , can then another <unk> be involved the subjects to make up , the just goes on the project mapped are , ever , after .
all this leads to a <unk> , in the heel all of information for all freely accessible are and the then of place to enter it can be .
by may also the tracks just , can be a , an identification , who 's where that allows us .
a dialogue box on playing field also means that one of the wishes , the residents in fact taken seriously be .
and is , they also then , if somebody says , i want a <unk> near the marketplace .
that can course , believing in rubbish be , but the goal must be , in <unk> dialog with all men 's <unk> , which is the right solution and maybe in <unk> then also the <unk> accommodate , but maybe there to take a different place .
again , it 's got to out of the dialogue is what happens then they appear .
second point are diverse <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
a feel to start to be completely comfortable , when he ago <unk> large group is up and you can talk .
a lot of others can , they do good writing want , but the text , then not ago <unk> large group to talk .
a others , ooh , maybe i 'd better or photographing it .
or will build his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i say it tries to have to different <unk> give them to get the different <unk> an organic to be .
we have here for instance , the possibility , just to come , there to be , naturally , you first time to watch , what happens .
in the background , ai small exhibition .
we have is the way i suppose , <unk> to give them .
we have the way i suppose , to paint .
we have the way i suppose , to write .
independent from age .
that was a <unk> girl .
we had the possibility , our ideas with their faces to connect to play with ideas to <unk> .
also the possibility , outside of <unk> <unk> , hard to participate in , should always been given to be .
that can for instance , about a <unk> happen , that can think about <unk> <unk> happen .
the <unk> and transparent having the results of the implication of the dialogue , under the are related .
we even have the entire process out all on facebook with this , and on a handful of independent blog and at the news <unk> about a <unk> distributed .
our third thing point <unk> .
you remember wondering , maybe it reminds me , and i said that <unk> often , too late on today .
what in my <unk> event there 's has been done three finished <unk> .
<unk> is the process , but only then when he early , takes place and the that those who best , even still do n't need to know what with <unk> area of the happen to decide .
if through the dialogue , and so that , i came back to investigate the point , one where i do , discussed this is , which scenarios for a area of the in the question is coming .
<unk> heard actually also to the <unk> itself .
and that is , then , if not from the beginning to being captured this is that the <unk> event that , and so look more and eventually , but on the experiences from the previous rebuild .
what happens now , if the road , citizens of your city academics and your city <unk> .
it 's already in numerous projects to see .
i cried . ' here 's a example from <unk> , this is the <unk> , is probably in many cases of this is known .
in new york was just a project launched , there 's hear them to get a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> 're there 's inside of six weeks <unk> dollars together to come to make the funding together can make should now , or <unk> .
the time has to tell us in august i wrote the politics , i could n't talk differently , as the idea to their own to do .
also the <unk> in new york , to the the i think i made ' i 'm not anymore to say to , because he has taken to one of the most <unk> the city 's become was no idea of the politics or educational administration .
in the opposite , the <unk> for the <unk> , were already areas .
in <unk> , so that we are coming back in germany , have the citizens are already it so plans to the very essence of a <unk> also again <unk> .
the city was involved in said <unk> 's not necessary .
the four weeks <unk> , that we for <unk> <unk> have to the rich are completely different than <unk> from .
today is the <unk> the city , offline .
during the side <unk> d e there it works and the city the <unk> , the the initiative , the road , there 's founded on it , and other <unk> supported .
and elsewhere paint the citizens of their own crossing in on the streets .
in rotterdam in the mind a <unk> <unk> .
everything well , and so far , i want you now say .
then we doing but now , just so on .
but i hold it for the wrong , the city of the responsibility to them .
why ?
one thing , , because they yes , a view for a 's been all have or should have .
during the dedicated , whether it be the citizens of initiatives , or businesses , it’s in the rule , going for them in some form the relevant than in the focus has the city against , the responsibility for the projects that were also on the edge of the attention to stand .
and to the other of course also if the city of the projects in a player , when we are other for is available to .
a <unk> initiative can this just <unk> order of .
also our goal was the way , a temporary initiative that after her school , and i noticed it was about half a year work , the results and the responsibility , among the city to pass wanted .

it run it , a negotiation .
therefore we have unfortunately is now in the problem that we keep the responsibility , you ca n't run a could .
but we know , so this already now , they said , if the city of the villa successful <unk> , if the negotiations can actually succeed , are , that then a <unk> on in this is .
in what form of the takes place however , is still quite frankly .
so to finally , to come and i 'm convinced of that many projects , the tone of their meaning , complexity or also their costs of the city will be developed must have a chance of happiness than being and positive identification , to create .
if you just in time and in the conversation with the citizens <unk> be .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each of the city and you all that they do tonight is sitting here .
if we our out into the claim , and at the policymakers the <unk> the citizens did n't even more than <unk> perceive , but as profitable .
this is it .
last night to see the <unk> we were here in <unk> in <unk> and are so far into <unk> come .
we have about <unk> spoke .
so , so this idea , like , it ai second chance to have , if it in this n't live was [ unclear , then there 's just still time , ai second chance .
we found very exciting .
and we were , but relatively fast as to agree that it is two things there is that do n't we still time you see that we wanted .
this one is the puberty .
the second , there was also sensitive to unit of the table , still time in the school ?


school , some of you remember wondering , maybe it , a humble out <unk> .
in trying to me , it is yes , so , now are the <unk> years ago , but the words , lead , in order to mind immediately to <unk> hands .

and then i actually do n't , how it at them was , but in my exams , was then always the the that with the <unk> taken seriously , has , the sitting always the next to me .
no idea , what 's from the actually become is .
they 're going to understand it , so , my high school , was really not beautiful and after i then my final <unk> behind me do was completely clear , never again , school .

with great desire and totally be part .
how she was there 's it on that ?
like this happened ?
that just started time you start to make that something happens is , doing what i do n't actually calculate that could .
i got kids .
so , my wife 's got the children .
and therefore i was then also very clear that you one that 's is , the road , to find these <unk> to take care had .
the way to the top of a day , when they said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and today , do you to myself .
yes , <unk> .
because i opened the door and then i was sitting there is sort of in this <unk> and whoa , i felt thrown in the <unk> .
that i saw this right from , how it back then , unlike us understand what .
and that it made it also still so how about how to school at that it made , and i <unk> ' me , human being here , which , yes , but really a failure is changing .

what is that , what we from high school , from this high school , actually for a 's life actually picked up of ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good learned .
where you have actually in your life <unk> already time i really good need to express ?
and you may have some still , like the capital from yugoslavia means .
what 's still time in yugoslavia ?
or <unk> , that capacity across a short time care as much more knowledge in politics . <unk> , just happen , so i do it ended up on a whole series , again <unk> can , until i 'm really bad will ?
well , i cried . ' that time needed for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what does is a <unk> of one the decimal point , one about from whether someone time a good doctor 's going ?
if the empathic , is , and if the good diagnostic of the land has ?


if we so look back , so about <unk> years , the middle of making <unk> century , there may that god , you voted on this .
this is the time , in the in germany , the <unk> then eventually got completely was introduced .
and where we also the school system , how we do it today has to its roots of mind .
and if we take the time back then imagine , then it was actually so , the people who at the had no access to know their time .


and the middle of making <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
that go there , which , do some changes in the world and there were suddenly people needs to the these new machines , and have been able to .
at the been , but also people needs to the these machines , wait , and repair it could .
and we needed to people , that these machines to build it could and that these factories were running .
maybe do you see it already .
that <unk> school system , that we now in germany , among many , so this is still have , has its root in this time .
and before a potentially make sense of the time .

do we <unk> at one in the future .
we let that <unk> century , where it is , and we can look at this year <unk> matters .
this year <unk> was the year , there was the first <unk> just about to become to pop .
i was with my my studies done , and i thought , now is the same point , now are you see you autonomously , the first company .
yes , after some of them to around me so with the internet , then <unk> ' i , then <unk> ' i think that now , this time from .
and some of companies are , among us <unk> and they were bigger and bigger and , and we 're so beautiful slow grown , and some of the companies are then clinging to us again , so in in free <unk> .
you see , makes two times in life .
and we had then after a few years now , but only 30 staff .
so , we had so , such a growth and we had so interesting thing about careers , among the ship like <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , if you ai you have no idea have , what these people do , but when i 'm going to school . went we had no idea that 's so what ever would give them .
even when i <unk> did was from so what 's like the the internet , you ca n't talk .
and the children , that we now to school . send out what good job required to the in 10 , six , twenty or about 30 years of ?
the the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and , which you know , which facts are going to the need to stand in those future jobs to succeed ?
and if you 're honest , also because the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 've been on so in the future looking , who could tell me , because the <unk> for the saturday , `` there .

well , it you see , they have no idea .
how we can get then out what to school for a 's lives learning experience is ?
what are the things , which we need to evaluate their kids for a 's life to fit to do ?
and maybe help , so a view in in this , what companies today , those employees to find yourself .
that that are yes , the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and the universities are coming then in the company .
and if you 're wondering , so it ai classic <unk> at , i realized , then it says , everything else . first in , yes , so what , like the expertise .
because i want to the yes , so the reading the road , then so , which we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and none of 12 years in offshore .
this is going to school right now , and also in the future ca n't afford .

and that you can essentially , in three different groups to summarize .
this is one thing , , businesses , want to acquire their employees , the flexible , are , so flexibility is that one .
and then i wish , i knew almost all companies in the staff with they tend to think .
and then , want to acquire this time , the staff , the <unk> are .
so we have flexibility leaders , thinking and predicts that .
we start with the flexibility to time .
this is relatively fast as hard time .
if we actually look , how economies , now works , how fast , naturally , yes , how fast , i knew anything changes .
<unk> , yes , the whole business models are getting from the internet of today on the morning on the head of really .
there practice , ' i staff , the with this change can deal .
there practice , ' i staff , the creative people are .
there practice , ' i staff , the <unk> are .
this is quite the exact opposite of the characteristics which in the factory in the late <unk> century of collaborators at the assembly line of needed had .
also the second subject of the entrepreneurial think is a quite clear .
there 's hear , around the responsibility .
there 's hear them to get people , the take responsibility .
so first time for liberal , and their own life .
but also for that telescope .
if this now , the company is , or as well as a society wish we meet people that take responsibility for that telescope .

and if we wanted to see that the football world cup , remember , then there 's , because the internet , these beautiful saying .
argentina , has <unk> <unk> portugal , has <unk> and germany has a team .

that were able to the only in common to create .
and this , which anyone , this big , and innovator our time , steve jobs , yes , <unk> .
it was not the , the the iphone invented has , the has not the <unk> invented , the has about itunes n't invented , the has nothing in it 's invented .
the had a team that this possible has done , because just as a team actually to the that we do , what they managed to have .
so it ai at school , that these three things to convey it could , that if only , but there ai at school , in the we for a 's lives learning .
but there 's still <unk> fourth point , and the is me almost still more important .
and this is the learning about ourselves .
if the one thing , what we think about the future , certainly going to tell you can this is that they uncertainty is then is now , but the ability , again and new to learn about and fun and offers to have this learning to experience the <unk> to mess we in the field for life , and that our children in the field for life to be at this is .
that if only ' yet , ai at school , that these things that we should .
but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the of them , the kids have a , to know , that 's not just ai event is , for the you <unk> to pay for .
so it ai event , after the slogan all it said , but still not from each other .
the way to the the same point , where <unk> 're elected , there will then suddenly all the invisible .
yes , i sat there and what should i say , it at the <unk> one of my kids were these <unk> still the funniest parts of the event .
less are fun , it was for me as a father , if if so the stress around them to get the theme of homework and learn the whole family life <unk> .
and still less fun makes it 's it , if the kid was sick is , because school in the stress this is now .
and finally ended up these <unk> or was a peak of these <unk> this point , school also again , so 'n <unk> .
so just took it was also not a <unk> , it was rather than that a <unk> , so the best thing to the last one hour and in fact , we were also the single parents , that were invited .
and i <unk> ' you now , and also reminded me the detail by the time after the same point was clear , we need to our child , because you take out , guess that 's not that .
<unk> are , but two years , in that we 're walking around have , because it 's done anything you do n't .
what do we really wrong ?
and we had actually make us the question i put it 's our child is broken ?
and we are the only , where it this is about ?

out there are very many , where it is very similar goes and that was two years ago , because i was sitting with <unk> <unk> together we were just the coolest , a new software company to reasons , have the day of us , i thought , where the journey because she goes , and night , we sat there to the bar and have us about the private things <unk> .
and what should i say , he has to me almost the same story telling a conversation with his kids did he almost the same experienced as we , and that we had been fortunate that we our children there could take could from high school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's one , it ai <unk> , looking at different schools and we could even a charter schools in to consider .
but can that everyone out there are doing ?

and after we both now the impression that had to school , which , since we were there 's not that gets really changed thought we , yeah well , we are the first , the topic that now time you go ahead .
just , how shall we as <unk> there anything you change ?
the good thing is that we be fooled into .
we 're not alone .
but we have a relatively fast , ai whole range of . one of people found a , what 's like going to have , how we , which is , ai at school to create a , all are related to enter it will .
it is yes , not so , that just the children and their parents down underneath the suffering , what out there are often happens .
if we take the teachers to look , only 30 percent of the teachers have <unk> .
if we actually look , like incarceration , the number of <unk> in the last 10 years has changed the business , doubled .
it can now be used to make all parents , what 's wrong to do ?
that all children are breaking down are and that 's also those teachers who fail , are ?
or it be that we keep a school system have , that just not more like this fits , rather like this <unk> ago <unk> years , the fit just as well , not more like this right .
and we have many people found , where it 's very much went and we 've even people found that do n't have kids .
and they 've understood you to take responsibility to reach for the future that you take responsibility to reach for the future , by showing you take responsibility for that , what we our children and the kids , the right now to school . go to hang on the way to give them .
and we have us to see that <unk> second to now gotten there 's out there ai whole range of . one initiatives , the school to change you want , and there 's there 's <unk> schools , here and there really neat <unk> and there 's almost any chance , every school teacher , the really involved , are and something to change you want .
and there 's even the a or another , courageous principal , the road , then also <unk> the first step to go .
and how we should now as <unk> help ?
we had yes , no concept , that we because now about helping us could .
but we can make one do , we can in those schools , go and we can hold of those schools in the people , the school in is , so the parents , the teachers and the students to bring together and we can with are in two days ai whole bunch of moving .
there are coming so people together , the in the past , rather than that other , have been working and the learning in two days , what it means to each to work .
the come with <unk> very concrete challenge the them together to solve .
and after two and so these days have the then , for example of a new <unk> developed sooner or the gun given for the ai entirely new in high as we have a wall of the berlin to school , just to be with you get to .
or the have no idea what your business for <unk> problems that they do in your school have , evolved .
inside of two days in common developed new approaches , the the next day , immediately , it has to return .
but what 's the <unk> is to what 's these two days happens , and that makes it for me then so beautiful the few weekends , the . i 've ' , then also time , among schools in all of germany to spend , is this energy , the because of thousands , if the three things to learn .

so sort of the leaders , thinking and if they range , as a team to experience .
then what does that a spark that 's in , etc. .
and if we are four weeks after so <unk> workshop , in places like this ai at school come back then learn that we 've seen that naturally , the school as a whole started has , to change , that there ai entirely new culture of about is .
and this is incredible <unk> .
and i <unk> ' they time i invite one new about the school to think .
i <unk> ' they time i invite , about education was thinking .
and i <unk> ' they do so , also to invite , about , over the school , to talk .
talk you about this , what you can enjoy , but i speak , they also that , despite what you n't like .
they will be surprised , how much disturbed , they get and how many people that same have experienced , but just did n't get to talk .
let them to us do you make us on every school in germany , into <unk> century , and bring .
let them to us the entire system in change .
and let them to us this together to do with the people the school day for a day that make , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because just a thing we can do this .
thank you .
