when steve lopez , funny things the go to los angeles times , one day through the streets in the center of go to los angeles , i went , he heard a wonderful music .
they came from a man , by an african-american , <unk> , really tough , homeless , the on a violin and playing , the only still two strings , had .
many of you are the story know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , that again , a movie was , with robert <unk> junior , when steve lopez , and jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the the <unk> , the sperm <unk> studied and the price of very promising career , sadly very early by his paranoid schizophrenia , i finished running .
nathaniel left the juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , living he as homeless man on the streets of <unk> row in the center of go to los angeles .
i recommend you all , <unk> book to read or road , the film to see that , so they 're not just the wonderful interconnectedness to understand that fit between these two men out of that is , but also , like the music , this link to build this helped and how they finally the instrument was , if this pun allows is , that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get one .
i met this mr <unk> in the years since 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney <unk> hall .


we came to give to say about music to talk . and a few days later i get an email , in the stood out that nathaniel , hard for <unk> stick with me interested .
i have to still going to mention , that nathaniel a medical practice <unk> , because he was already with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> treated been , a trauma that gave him to be whole life , are you would .
as a result of that he is now , particularly prone to these schizophrenic stages . that are sometimes it gets so , and he days and disappearing , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , always this horror and the <unk> of his own mind exposed .
and in so just a <unk> found myself wondering , nathaniel , when we do with our first to class in the walt disney <unk> hall , began . he had this misdirection flickering in his eyes and this seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible demons and smoke and about , how it until someone in your sleep , poison and i wanted .
i was afraid , not donated , but i was afraid that i do with him lose it could that he 's in a function of the conditions , get it could and that i was to its relationship to being a violin destroying it could , when i started , about <unk> and <unk> and others have been an order of the <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started so easy to continue to play .
i played the first set of <unk> <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed on , that in <unk> eyes a <unk> change ago , they 've been about .
it was , as if he walked underneath the impact of an invisible have is it said , a chemical response , head of the catalyst for my game was .
<unk> <unk> anger , turning little , in understanding , in a quiet , curiosity and the grace .
and how through a miracle , he took his violin and began to aspire to be heard some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , you to end to play : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
and we started then you to take about music to talk , started from the stream video of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , of <unk> to more <unk> <unk> .
and i was quickly realized that he 's not just a <unk> know about music owned , but it , with her also a tight personal relationship on there .
he spoke of her with a passion and a deeper understanding , that else i just from my colleagues in philharmonic of go to los angeles know there .
by he 's music playing and about music , talking , was out of this <unk> , confused man , the men 's still going through the streets of go to los angeles moved was , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the juilliard <unk> musicians have become .
music is medicine . music , changes us .
for nathaniel means that music <unk> health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and delusions , with help his imagination and creativity in something to be asked <unk> .
and so <unk> he shares his <unk> that 's being .
i understood that she 's exactly this the nature of the art is .
exactly this is the reason , why we music to do : so that we do something that in all of us , in the back inside of us is , our feelings , by our artistic lens , by our creativity to the reality of shape can .
and the fact , it 's one that expression reached all of us , and moves , inspired , and it unites us .
what nathaniel <unk> , so it brought him the music back in a community of friends .
the <unk> power of the music got him back in a family of musicians , the him in mind , the be a talent and i realized , and it , <unk> .
and i 'm and around with nathaniel playing music , no matter whether in the walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me that sort of why i musicians have become 'm .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want something to play , that i <unk> the <unk> you one of have .
i hope that you pardon me .
so i have in my life , many fishes 'd known .
i just two loved .
this first , that was more like a passionate <unk> .
it was a beautiful fish , <unk> , good <unk> , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what for a fish .
still better , he was in <unk> after the whereas the highest standards of sustainability seeing .
you could be wondering , so we think we have , and feel to him to sell it .
i had with this beauty of a relationship with about several months .
one day -- called the head of the company , phone , he said , if i at a event you tell you might think about the sustainability , the farm .
`` course , '' , i said .
here was a company , the to figure it was trying to do in this unimaginable problem for our chefs 's become . how do n't tell you 're a fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the oceans , pulled out how we forests <unk> done all have .
it 's hard to the destruction began to <unk> .
90 percent of the big fish , the message that we love , the major tuna , the <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they 're collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so i will probably , or the evil <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future be .
a lot of arguments against it . <unk> pollute the environment , the most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take these tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds <unk> are required , so that you a pounds <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
they’re also not very good .
so here was finally one company that were trying to it right to do .
i wanted they supported .
a day of years ago , the event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company that matters .
we call him , don .
`` well , don '' , i said , `` just with the facts , right to have to it 's you get famous for it , so far out in the ocean as opposed to spread her the environment is n't stop messing up . ''
`` this is true . '' , he said . `` we 're so far out , that the waste of our fish and distributed going to do n't quite concentrated . ''
and then i added he 's add , `` we 're in basically a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , '' , he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one of what ? what so an her ? ''
`` sustainable and proteins , '' , he said .
`` great '' , i said . he put on .
and so , you that night was kind i in bed and i thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i called the next day , a moment ago , the event , don matters .
i said , `` don , what the example are sustainable and proteins right ? ''
he said , he yourself into this is not . he 'll <unk> .
now , i get on with a few people in the company . nobody could tell me a <unk> answer to give them . until i finally worked with the <unk> biologists to get on .
we call him as well , don .
`` well , don '' , i said , `` what the example are sustainable and proteins right ? ''
now , he mentioned , some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers to the skin , <unk> , this day , <unk> and to forage data structure . ''
i said , `` how much percent <unk> <unk> 's chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption of maybe two percent .
`` well that are about 30 percent . '' , he said .
i said , `` don , what 's sustainable package it , grilled chicken , seen fish to feed ? ''
it gave a long to break in the length of and he said , `` there 's easy to a lot of the chicken , the globe . ''
i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not , because i was a <unk> <unk> and <unk> 'm .
that i am actually .
no , i <unk> fact , from this fish <unk> , because , i swear , unlike god , the fish , after this conversation that for chicken , tasted it happen .
this second fish , that 's a different kind of year-old .
it 's the romantic sort of , the way , the side of you , ever better if you his fish will know that learning , you the fish you cut more love you .
i 've got it first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
a <unk> journalist who had been thinking about from this fish will spoke .
they us has kind of the <unk> .
he came on the table with a bright , almost glowing in the white color .
the chef who had him <unk> .

amazingly , was he still delicious .
who can a fish that well taste and let me , after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy could it .
we call him miguel . actually means he miguel .
and no , he has the fish do n't cooked , and he 's not a chef . at least on the way that they do and i <unk> understand .
he 's a biologist in her <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
you is near the <unk> years of the river <unk> .
until in the 1980s , was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they 're domesticated <unk> on the inside , in basically the wetlands were .
they made that , by them the country <unk> .
they built this complicated the result of the channels , and they had urged water out of the land out and out into the river .
now , they could n't go beyond one thing that was fine , not be economically .
and ecologically it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of the birds in the words , which for this place , many birds are .
and so has since 1982 , a spanish company with green the country and did .
what you have done ?
they have the rivers of sugar water , and vice versa .
they have literally the levers <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> did they the channels to pick the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a 11,000 acres <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , eel that -- and as i 've miguel , and his company in the environmental destruction , completely other way .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have thought that was still never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , the one million miles away is , and everything what you see are <unk> channels and this dense , lush , which has .
i was there ago , `` not long time with miguel .
he 's a really incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part `` a crocodile , to kiss people . ''
okay ? because we were and she fought for us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , you have more mud , up to my travels at , , and miguel holding in peace one <unk> .
here you can take he 's a rare <unk> , and out .
now i said before he the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , see here he 's a pattern of split , that it , the day of <unk> giraffe , reminds us .
it turns , totally out that miguel on the back part of his career in <unk> national park in africa has spent by .
i asked him , he was like to be as a <unk> 's become .
he said , `` fish ? i know anything about the fish .
i 'm a expert on for those relationships . ''
and then goes , he and off into the road , in more mumbo-jumbo of very top of birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and you know about me not going wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was weak force of this <unk> piece , here 's the fish , that i was in the brink of had .
so i put him at random . i said , `` miguel , how it comes out that , your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed on the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships , this is incredible .
but what we eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , he which goes on for me to tell that it is so a , rich system is that , the fishes better food , what you in the wild eat it would .
the vegetable biomass , the phytoplankton , the <unk> , this is it , what the fish , so an .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there 's no forage .
and space of a farm heard , the their animals not so an ?
later on day and went out , i this site , with miguel around and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , the so obviously this seems to be '' , different than any farm , on the i ever been was , `` how much it , you are succeeding ? ''
in the moment , it was , as if a <unk> a <unk> order to have to .
and we must bow to take the corner and we care provided fact , the most incredible sight , thousands and pinker flamingos , a literally , pinker carpet , so far the eye can see .
`` that 's success . '' , he said .
`` look you from their bellies in dutch , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> they do n't find your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose within 20 percent of our fish and <unk> the day of birds .
now , last year were on this site 600,000 , birds , more than 250,000 interesting ways .
it 's now the largest and one of the most important to private <unk> in all of europe has gone .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last , that you on a <unk> have to finish ? ''
he 's going , his head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> matter to do n't be intensely .
that 's a sea , who came network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .

okay , let them to us that i 'll think . a farm , the their animals not so an and a farm , the their success , among the health services to predators measuring .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way , i should those flamingos of the first place , not even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the evaporated is better for the <unk> .
every morning to fly them up 240 miles to the farm .
and every night fly them up 240 miles back .
they do that because they the <unk> white line the highway <unk> follow can .
seriously .
i had been a kind of the journey of the penguins imagined , so i looked i miguel , together .
i said , `` miguel , fly them up 240 miles to the farm and fly you then the 240 miles back on the evening ?
when they do that for the children ? ''
he looked me of , when i would have just a song of the whitney houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they do that because the food is better . ''
i 'm not the skin of my beloved of the fish mentioned , made delicious was , and i do n't like <unk> . i like they do n't <unk> . i like they do n't be crisp .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i cooking , almost never seen it .
and yet , when i told them in this restaurant in <unk> tried to do you have more , it has does n't even after <unk> tasted candy .
they she liked the sweet and pure , as if you a bites , from the ocean take it would .
i mentioned that number , miguel , and he nodded .
he said , `` the skin , so it looks like a swam .
you is the last <unk> , until something in the body to enter into .
they which , in the course evolution has evolved to pick <unk> suck . ''
and then i added he 's add , `` but our drinking water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , the your fish are not so an . a farm , the their success to measure the reason for success to its predators .

it 's a river , the all the things with hormones , leads , of which are rivers so today to tell us tend to them with , hard to lead , chemical pollutants , drain of <unk> .
and if it happen through the system , fought has and this leaves is the waters clean , as how it <unk> is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , the their animals not so an , not just a farm , the their success , among the health services to predators measuring , but a farm , the literally a <unk> is , and not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i take him , and that they should also do , because these year-old , like a romantic , anything that , is also telling .
you could tell you to a recipe is for the future of good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what we now we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food is actually good taste .
but for many people like this is a little to radically changed .
we 're not <unk> , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love this little <unk> . we 're talking about local food . we eat be organic .
and if you to suggest that that the things are , the the future of good food can assure you think there is somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey , people , i love the pink flamingos , but how you will feed the world ?
how you will feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not , because we already have enough calories are producing , across the world more than just to feed .
one billion people will now <unk> .
one billion -- this is more than ever before -- because of <unk> inequalities , in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question is not , because they the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years about to be pretty depressed .
<unk> grain of the best <unk> , <unk> to see that <unk> , chemicals , among the earth , grilled chicken , seen fish , and all the time has the agribusiness , just wondered : `` if we more people who do you feed , how awful can it be ? ''
that was the <unk> . it was the justify . it was the plan that the american agriculture .
we should they call , what you is , a if you really in <unk> , a if you really , that fast , who came capital <unk> , the characters that production of the technologies .
this is not if you really , and it 's not invent agriculture .
our <unk> today is threatened , not because of <unk> <unk> , but because of <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through a fertile one country , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by the chainsaws , but through the forests , and not by were doing is , and nets , it by the fish in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
let them to us to start with the question : how we going to us to feed itself ?
or better , how we can help conditions to create a , every community to enable themselves , to feed ?
so to the to do , look at not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's actually done .
capital , chemistry and ever-faster machines are supposed to think it <unk> and it has never heard something really good to the food produced .
we can look instead , the environmental role model of pollution .

look , you want miguel , despite the farmers how miguel ,
<unk> that do n't worlds for liberal , are , <unk> , that restore , rather <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> grow , rather than just hard on , farmers , the not just <unk> are , but experts , for those relationships ,
because they are the ones who also become experts , for the flavor from .
and when i really be honest , i 'm are they become a better at us as i do it ever be going .
so you know that 's me , right , because if that the future of good food is , will they are delicious be .
thank you .
it , if i do you today , one thing to share with want is it , that the <unk> the data , that we consume , greater is as the sum of bits and instead and it turns out , we <unk> to think i want you to think about how we information so you can use , they said , totally different patterns start to make and we so these trends realize that were otherwise would n't have been visible , be .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> after the old way that the .
this program , that i 'm here i use , is a little experiment .
it means <unk> and what i do with <unk> i can do this is that i after a certain death amongst those filters can , we say , accidents .
and instantly i see a different patterns , the road , you odd .
and it 's this , because in <unk> here in the people at the <unk> are and they over here at the <unk> are .
we can one step further out and once they 're the data , then the new , and see that <unk> and cancer , the usual suspects , are , however , not for everyone .
if we now happen , and after the age <unk> , we say , 40 years or a younger , we see me , and accidents , even the cause is about the road , the people that are going to start thinking .
and who <unk> see , that 's this , especially in men is true .
they recognize so why that look of information and data in this way , very moment to swim in a vivid <unk> reminds us .
and if we do this for raw data can do why not also for the content of ourselves ?
what we now have here are the covers , every single , `` the sport <unk> '' , the ever printed were .
it 's all over here . it 's everything online .
you can it would like after my talk , in their rooms and test .
with <unk> can you to pull in a decade .
you can get inside in a particular year .
you can go directly to a certain copy to jump .

i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so i click to here what defines to start to me all spending to show in which have lance armstrong mentioned will .
now , when i just a <unk> so people get want to be that i think , `` ok , what if i told me anything with the subject of walking , i look ? ''
so i leave a step back and <unk> the perspective .
now i see greg <unk> .
and so you get an idea of them , that if you this how information scans , specifically , , much more <unk> , <unk> , then you look for you do n't or <unk> 're not just .
you does something that actually a bit different is .
it 's something between , and we think it 's changing the way , and the way as information can be used .
i want this idea now a little further carry out with about what a little crazy is .
what here we 've done is , we have every single <unk> taken and they 're going on a little summary of boils down .
the summary contains a quick <unk> and a symbol of the area out of that they come .
i 'll show you only time the top , 500 in the most popular <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can a lot of things do .
immediately get we have a an idea of the themes that go on wikipedia , at the popular ones are .
i 'm now the issue <unk> ' vote .

this is really important , because this is an insight is that do n't in a single <unk> would be there .
this is just to recognize when you a step as women and the whole thing at them .

now if i say these individuals would consider see anything i realized that the majority of them <unk> are . some people come from the science . some , still less , come from the economy . here is my boss . and one of coming out of the <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can now to jump , and a view on all the ted prize winner 's have .
you see , we 're surfing on the net the first time as if it also really a net is , not only from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want you what else to show what a little surprise to be alive .
i 'll show you here just enjoying the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i want it 's not a browser , as it ; it 's really not a browser , but you can websites , so look -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website , like this .

the sand is important , because you just through that look from the web pages in this way , and the way , all the <unk> on the same way , and the way at can .
so i can in my course of zoom in a certain <unk> .
there 's the catch up all across the demonstration , i went up to go this thought we 've gone .
and i can , so to everything , what i am today i 've never considered , to have , back to life .
and , when i went back a step <unk> and on everything i look , can i mean by the trend is new , put them might call to my <unk> . here , i 've been , <unk> ' `` for , here has been , bing , right here we call to live labs <unk> .
and of this is , i in the side of walking into and they go back to bring up .
it 's a metaphor , the again and it 's used , and every time , it makes the box , more than the sum of the <unk> .
the moment , in this world , we think that sharing data a curse those are .
we talk from the time you curse , who 's <unk> .
we talk from `` drowning in information . ''
what , if we this situation turn around could and the internet on the head to ask , so that we instead of always from one to the other to go to start of many things to many things go to capture , and it creates pattern of see , which otherwise , hidden on with us like ?
it , if we do this can do , then is this record <unk> , maybe a new source make more information .
and , instead , it’s just being in information to move , can we know that , and get .
and if we know that experience , then we can maybe even the wisdom that , and draw .
so that i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction , on .
in my school sweetheart and went i do with the bus to school , every day an hour per route .
and my nose was what 's always in a book , a <unk> , that my mind in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> way my deep in me <unk> , voracious curiosity satisfied .
this curiosity that long , too , in it , that i always , when i do n't look at school was , by the forests <unk> , walked and `` samples . '' which collected , frogs and snakes and the beetle , and <unk> , everything , looking at home to paint and underneath the microscope , i looked at .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was about it is the always wanting to the trial , the world to understand and the limits of sorts of explore the .

jacques cousteau came in our living with his fascinating about those are some of us animals and places and a world full of wonder , they did , that we , she 'd never would have can imagine .
that has then probably very good to 's when the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's neither of video still these <unk> with computer-generated movies are still there is the imagery in the media landscape , there , i had to the images in my head of activities .
that we had to be at all . if we as kids a book , all read , we took the description of the author and projected them in the screen in our minds .
my response to that was the drawing , and draw from alien , alien worlds , robots , spacecraft , and all so what .


and as i was done something interesting . what i can find is what happens to jacques <unk> what they were intrigued , was the thought , next one of us to be completely unknown world here on our planet itself .
certainly would i yes , never an alien world with a spaceship at reaching . that it struck me pretty unlikely .
but here was a world , that i actually ever been able to here on the earth , and they was pretty much amazing , and more exotic as all that , what i must always imagined i had , when i these books have read it had .
so i decided , when i was 15 , divers , to be .
the only problem , man was that i do in a small village in canada , living , one , over 12,000 miles from the next ocean away .
it . i made , i told me , but not <unk> .
i 've been bugging my father , until he finally one <unk> in <unk> , new york , finding out -- they did , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of the <unk> out in the winter , in <unk> , new york .
the ocean , but , a real , the ocean , then i got only two years later to face , when we call to california to flat .
since , in the 40 years , the by now <unk> are , i spent about three to 10,000 hours , under water spent . 500 million hours of them in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich , among <unk> life is , how we do it gives us really hardly anyone can imagine .
the realm of nature knows , no borders , very in as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
the way to any kind of days i feel that i deepest awe , for that , what i on my <unk> i see .
and my love to the ocean holding her to , with the same intensity as it has always and ever .
when i told me then as adults , a profession <unk> , it was that <unk> .
that seemed the best opportunity , my inner drive to , stories to tell , with my need of , images to create , to unite .
as a child would fly , i always on the comic books and so .
so they were the movies , the way , images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
of course , was the stories that i told me <unk> , out of the science fiction , `` the terminator , '' , `` aliens , '' , and `` <unk> . ''
and in fact , `` <unk> '' i could my preference for the <unk> and that that come with the <unk> connect .
so intertwined . they can sort of the my two passions .
something interesting happened in playing `` <unk> '' : to find a <unk> problem in this film to solve -- and that is , we had to be as a kind of liquid <unk> create -- , <unk> we on a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what , man came out , was the first a computer-generated <unk> , the ever in a film to see it was .
the movie , got that is , no money off , right told them was he just over time , his was caused by a , now , but i noticed something amazing thing : the audience cities around the world was like <unk> from the magic , the of it was writing .

they saw so something magic .
and that i found it 's incredibly exciting .
and then i thought , `` wow , this must have access in the <unk> be involved . ''
so we went in `` the terminator , two '' , my next movie , still much further .
together with <unk> created an we there , the guy of liquid metal . the success was hanging , for one . ab , like this effect arrive would .
and it worked . again , we had something magic is created . and the effect in the audience was the same . however , we have with the movie ever been a little bit more money <unk> .
of these two experiences from some , was a very new world has reached , a very new world of creativity , for <unk> .
so i founded a company , along with my good friend <unk> winston studio , the to speak at the best <unk> and <unk> was . she was called `` the digital <unk> . ''

did that we then also , and wildlife of us so for a while a comparative advantage .
but the middle of the '90s years , we realized we now , but that we keep in <unk> and <unk> -- what we want the company , yes , actually started , had -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` the avatar . '' written , that the <unk> in manipulation of visual effects and <unk> effects in all of new heights say it should , with the realistic human , expressive characters , the using <unk> made were essentially . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world should <unk> be .

so , shifted that i believe that and made this other movie about the big ship , that goes down .
the the <unk> i have this as `` romeo and juliet on a ship . '' and sells . it was a <unk> distilled <unk> , a passionate film .
in ways , but i wanted to actually to the real cover up the titanic immerse ourselves .
it 's why i have the film did .
this is the truth . the studio , i knew that , but not .
i put them , but i am convinced , by i said , `` we that come to the the cover up . we filming the real cover up .
we 're going to it in the <unk> years of the movie , and show .
this is hugely important . it 's a good <unk> reserved for marketing . ''
and i <unk> you , an expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that goes back down to that , that your own imagination a reality to make it can .
we created then actually , six months later a reality , in the time i was in a russian <unk> thrust into , four kilometers from the surface of what the atlantic , and me to the real titanic , through a <unk> was looking at .
that was no movie , no <unk> , that was real .
so , that has really amazes me just blew .
and the preparation that energy were enormous . we had cameras and a spotlight , and all sorts of building .
and i 've noticed on the way you very these <unk> , a <unk> similar , .
well , it they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you go up in this capsule , then that he 's you in this dark , hostile environment , down , where no hope kept on the salvation of sand , if you do n't it yourself back to do work .
and then i thought , `` wow , that 's just as well , as if i 'm in <unk> .
this is actually really cool . ''
i was in fact , it became obsessed from studying the deep ocean .
anyway , of the right-hand part , the with curiosity and science to do it happen . it was it . it was an adventure , it was curious . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience , made me to hollywood to do n't give you could .
because , you know , i was able to me a creature , imagine , for that we then a visual effect of the design could . but i could n't tell me that we can imagine , what i the trappings of a window would see .
some , the following expeditions to have i being in <unk> seen , and sometimes these things , which i still never seen before i had , sometimes we also of things that we even still no seen before i had , and for that science to the same point , when we do you saw , still does n't even words , had found .
that has made me so that 's really transformative , and i wanted more .
and so i met , then a something unusual decision .
after the success of `` titanic '' i said to me , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood on the ice , you put and i 'm going for a while <unk> . ''

we returned to the cover up the titanic back .
we took this little robot , that we built had a , a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> and wondering , the inside the ship to see that , what you 've never did was on .
nobody had ever the inside <unk> demands . you had still not for another . so we evolved the necessary to technology .
well , and there sitting i now , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> , that these <unk> here 's quite similar , and of which i know that once the band , there , played by .
and i was flying along with a little <unk> through the aisles away from the ship .
i <unk> it is , they just really , but my mind is within the cutting-edge technology .
it felt crucified by , , as if i little exercise within the <unk> the titanic here today , .
that was the <unk> form of a <unk> , that i ever experienced , to have . because before i move forward to find a corner <unk> , i knew i have always , what the same in <unk> years of the cutting-edge arise that would , because i for months about going <unk> , all that was , when we the film did that .
this is set it was , which is an exact replica of the plans , in the space ship .
so this was a highly strange and experience .
they made me this <unk> to be aware that you have such <unk> avatars are using and so that own consciousness in the vehicle , in these different form of existence where there 's can .
it was really it 's incredibly profound
and may also a brief reference on this , what might be in a few decades could happen , if you <unk> has to pick something to explore , or other things to do , in all sorts of <unk> <unk> , i went to me as <unk> can imagine .
after these expeditions we started this , what we get down there had seen , really appreciate to learn , for instance , these <unk> , where we these amazing how fast , animals saw . that are sort of the aliens , but here on earth .
they live with help of chemosynthesis .

and so you see animals , the right next one of 500 different degrees are called that they there are surviving can .
of the same time was interesting thing that i am also very much for <unk> , that was again , the <unk> from my childhood .

that was fascinating .
but the end , ran it on the way beyond that i do <unk> with us in the deep took .
i took them with and <unk> you access to the world down there : <unk> , <unk> , people , the road , for such extreme situations interested . i took them to the sources , with , so that , you want you look around , samples to take and instruments , see what we could and so forth .
we did that is , to documentary , run , but actually science , more specifically , <unk> .
so joined the fact , the circle anywhere between my existence as <unk> , then , as a kid , and the those positions in the reality .
in over these as in i have a lot learned .
i have a lot about science learned . but i now think they certainly , a director must also can lead , a leader be like a <unk> or so .
i understood , but not a lot of leadership , before i do this ocean expeditions <unk> .
because of just a certain point i had to tell me , `` what i do is actually here ?
why i do is that ? what comes and it turns out ? ''
these stinking films to bring us no money , a .
we play time just that was caused by a . of fame , not a lane .
all think , i was right between , `` titanic '' and `` the avatar . '' <unk> and i 'd made me , somewhere in the nails it on a towel the beach <unk> .
i 've all these films , these documentary , for a very small audience did .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what are you just ?
you 're doing it comes to the task will , which to the challenge will to -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , that there 's . you 're doing it means that the <unk> because of , and because of the weird to rate , the web of the same is a small group of people a team , you create .
because we have all this with just about 10 to 12 people did , the many years , 24/7 've become adults . sometimes we were to two three months after a row on the lake .
and in this community you realize that one of the most important thing that will be aware is a , you ago , each has , because you a task , it does it has a , you to any other things can explain .
if you to any country <unk> and wondering , says , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and the very different way around , the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , if you on sea to work , '' , then you do that other just do n't explain . this is the same for the officer or share with soldiers , the something together we have gone through and you know that they do it never met anyone can explain .
because it 's becoming a connection , a lot of each other respect .
when i so i came back to cut my next film `` the avatar . '' to turn , i tried to the same <unk> to apply , which is that you could be a team and respected and wondering , in return , of who respect , deserves .
by it was the dynamics really changed .
because i stood so again with a small team on <unk> terrain . we did that , `` the avatar . '' with a new technique that it before , but not there .
it 's incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of four and years to a right family .
it creates completely changed the road , my way , films to do , completely .
it was giving people , that were like , we could have these <unk> yes , really good <unk> and on the planet pandora 's used to go .
for me it was more a <unk> way , my job to do , the really the process , the road , in the result has changed .
what we can so from all of close ?
what kind of lessons we 've learned ?
i think , at the first , in , what about the curiosity .
it 's the most powerful than human property .
our imagination is a power shift , even a reality to make it can .
and the warning off your team is more important than all over <unk> this world .
come to me boy , filmmaker , the say , `` give them to me a profound advice , as i thought that was can do . ''
and i say , `` <unk> you , not even a .

the nasa has been so a <unk> , `` failure is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and on the study has to fail , an alternative to be , because there i guarantee that 's a leap .
no significant endeavor , that innovation for at , was ever , without risk of being addressed .
you must be willing to find these risks on wondering , to take .

today i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and that i 've just maybe something that , because my <unk> it at the foundation , mainly due to vaccines , and seed is about the space to the things , which we reinvent ourselves and deliver to kind of them to the poorest two billion a better life to get there .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , right , we took even more important than for each other on the planet .
<unk> says that leads to the <unk> over many years to do n't grow to be . it we 're going to a lot sooner or to little bit of rain . the things to be wondering , so we change , it 's on their fragile environment is not withstand more you .
this leads to <unk> . it leads to the uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , is a climate change , terrible for you will .
another thing is the <unk> for you very important .
the fact this is that , if you just from one thing the price to reduce this could , to the <unk> would energy efficient in far and at the most effective .
now , the <unk> is about the time , like it .
actually based the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> towards the industrial revolution , phone itself in the 20th century . there 's a <unk> case in <unk> and why we 've refrigerators , <unk> , we can fully modern materials to manufacture and so many things do .
we 're here so in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we the price is get -- we let us the price in case -- we meet on a new green barrier , and this barrier on us with carbon together .
co2 up after the planet and the equation for carbon is actually pretty clear .
they <unk> that <unk> co2 , which to the <unk> leads , and these <unk> has some very negative to follow . effects on the weather and maybe even worse , the indirect a result , that the natural ecosystems to start to such <unk> changes not to shift can and so the whole systems to come together .

and there 's safe <unk> about , how bad those consequences will . but they will be extremely they ca n't be a man .
i have the <unk> times , and asked , `` we need to really shut down on the near zero to come ?
not enough that half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we 're near zero to come , is the temperature on giving rise .
why it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a three and feet high truck , the under a number 3 feet a bridge from , i should . the then you can sort of the <unk> ago . they ran out .
this one must be very , looking down , on a zero .
now , we run into every year a lot <unk> from , about the 26 billion pounds .
every american about 20 tons . people of the poor countries , less than one .
in the average people are 's about five million tons for each one on the planet .

it 's far , constant progress has gone .
just a variety of economic transformations to have it actually also influenced by and we need to of <unk> rise to reduction go and to a reduction , up on a zero .
this equation , has four factors . a little <unk> . you have this thing left -- and co2 -- that gave them towards zero to break , and this is from the number of the people depend , of the service , that every person in the average use that , the average of energy for every service and the the co2 , the per <unk> <unk> will .
let them to us so every single factor of individually look and just think we , how we this in a zero to get .
probably needs to one of these numbers very close relative to zero to come .
now this is the basic algebra , but we go about it 's time through .
first , we have the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people ,
and it may even on 9 billion to . the now , there is nine billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could this as well , according to 10 percent returned to 15 percent mortality down , but at the time we see a slope of them to 1.3 .
the second element of these are the services , that we use .
that includes all , the food , that we eat , clothing , television , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> mean , those services , almost every working on the planet accessible to .
it 's wonderful life is that number drops .
in the rich world , in the upper half billion , we could probably <unk> do and less use , but in the average is that number of every year go up , little brain so collectively , more than double , as well , services , the per person being put together to be .
here we see a very basic health service . there 's going to home light , so that you the homework can read it ?
and these students have n't it , so they go out and reading your <unk> under the <unk> .
well over , efficiency , the the e , the energy per service , there 's finally got news .
we have something that 's not going up ,
now because of different successes in <unk> , each other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , whose <unk> some single human services , let me , they 've been to 90 percent to reduce .
in other service , like the manufacture of <unk> , 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the the <unk> or <unk> , is the scope for improvement , very much smaller .
in general , if we optimistic 're going to get we might be a reduction of them to a factor , three or maybe even if to a factor of six .
but what in the first three factors , we are now of 26 billion dollars on may <unk> 13 billion tons of gone . and that comes just not from scratch !
we look so the fourth factor of lawsuits -- and this is a x-factor be -- this is the amount of co2 , the per <unk> <unk> will .
it turns to start to the question , if you this in a zero to get it can .
if you coal , burning : no .
if you gas will burn : no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> now , the co2 , except that renewables , and my rocketry that .
so , what we were on a global level to make it must , is , a new paradigm to create .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders , '' i use , i mean , not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the pc is a miracle .
the internet and the price of services is a miracle .
the people here have to the development of a lot of this miracle that contributed .
normally , there 's not a deadline , that you a miracle up to a period of date , needs .
normally think there is you sort of the only that said , and some people come , wo n't .
in this case we need to but <unk> , and give a miracle in very short time getting .
now , i wondered , how can i think that really <unk> ?

i think back to where the last year , when i mosquitos to paint and somehow i liked the people that .
the idea was for you actually intangible , you know , that 's people there , the with these mosquitos to live .
for energy , i noticed that here 's a .
i decided that its <unk> of fireflies , my <unk> contribution to the environment that would be here .
so here are a couple of natural fireflies .
you has taught me an institution that you to do n't bite . in fact , they will probably wo n't time that glass , left .
now , there 's all kinds of <unk> like this , but they bring all not much .
we need a solution , either one or what one of the one of unimaginable scaling , and how incredible <unk> have . and although it many different directions , there , in which people do , we find yourself , i see is really just five , that these big the needs can afford .
i tides , <unk> , the merger and better biofuels leave out .
this afford to maybe a <unk> contributions and if you better to afford , when i expect , that would be awesome , but i mean the core here is that , we hold of all those who are five have to work , and we ca n't of you give up , because they us <unk> , because all have significant problems .
we can look at first the burning fossil fuels , despite the burning of either of coal or gas .
what you there 's do have to , though they may simply , but this is n't . you have to take all the co2 , that after the burning of the top of clockwork comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then , somewhere between them and hope that it is there 's left .
there 's some <unk> , the that on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it on 100 percent to get is very difficult to be . and a way that is for the storage out over the co2 to make major , is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who would have to make sure ?
who can do something i guarantee , which literally , many billions of times bigger than any type of garbage , the you 're wondering , of <unk> and other things we can imagine ?
this is a lot of volume .

the next thing : my rocketry that .
the also has three big problems . the cost , mostly in <unk> countries are high . the question after security , that you really feel that she 's nothing to go wrong can , despite the human participation , that the fuel not for weapons , it 's used .
and what do you then with the garbage ?
because even though he 's not very large is , there 's lots of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may soluble , are , and tunnels , which you why i work should .
the last three the five , i 've summarized .
it are those renewables , how they often be called .
and also the have -- although it is great , you to do n't make fuel needs to -- they have some downsides .
one thing , is the <unk> , that these technologies create dramatic lower than the of <unk> .
that are <unk> , you talk about of many <unk> , a thousand times more land area as a normal power station .

the sun does n't seem to the whole day , they seem to also not every day and much blows also the wind and not the time .
why you have to , you kind of these various sources to which is , a way to have to the energy also in times when they do n't is available , to get .
there 's so here 's great <unk> . there 's the challenges it at the transmission . if we for example , say , that the energy source outside the country is related to do you need not just the technology , you must also with the risk to deal , that the energy from where different from .
and there 's the <unk> .
and the radiation dimension to show , i went on all kinds of the batteries , that are made , to view , the work for cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything . and that i did with the amount of the an electrical energy , which the world using , compared . i found out that all the batteries , that we now producing , less than 10 minutes of the <unk> them , you could .
we need so here 's a big medical breakthrough , something that business plan to a factor of 100 times better will be , as the approaches to the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not so easily .
that happens , you 're trying to these <unk> sources of as we say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of making <unk> to earth .
if , you want to occur 100 percent goes to sustain want to do you need an incredible with was .
now , where we going to go : what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project , '' ? how we come i going to target ?
what we need are many companies , the problem with this work . hundreds of .
in every one of these five areas , we need at least 100 people .
in many cases you will say : that are nuts . that 's good .
i think , here in the ted group there 's many , the road , there 's already be engaged .
bill are big has several different companies , under the other than one named <unk> the great <unk> has .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies , the great things do and interesting ways to have and i try this to support .
nathan myhrvold and i pay for a company , the , may surprise , the nuclear approach to follow .
there 's some innovations in <unk> ; this modular , liquid .
the development has in this industry ago , some time i stopped , so it 's no big surprise that some of good business concepts , lying .
that <unk> says that you instead of a part for years of the <unk> the sound of a percent , that <unk> , we decided to the 99 percent and burn , that <unk> .
this is quite a crazy idea .
but actually did you about it already too long time thinking , but you could never as to simulate , whether it would work , but since it modern supercomputer that there , you can do it to simulate and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it looks like that looks like , that it <unk> .
and because you these 99 percent of burning , is that <unk> very much better .
actually burning , you the garbage , and you can even the waste of any kind of reactors operate as <unk> use .
instead , i knew about the head to break , burn them gave it . a great thing .
this highly enriched uranium is being incremental and it uses , a little bit like a candle .
you see that 's a way that pillar is , often than `` a traveling wave of reactor '' by .
that solve really the <unk> .
here 's a picture of a their place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . you has the part , the today , and where you will , <unk> so it says , <unk> uranium .
the reverse engineer the u.s. for hundreds of years , together .
and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you get enough of fuel for the what have you lifetime of what the planet .
you know , there 's there are still many challenges , but it 's a sample of many hundreds of concepts , that we need to get you forward to come .
just think we said , how we do our success to measure should .
how should our testament to look like ?
now , we go up to come to the goal , that we have to get and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many speak of giving 80 percent reduction , until 2050 .
it 's actually very important that we get there will get .
the rest of 20 percent to be in the poor countries to be produced , and [ are still something that agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement , until then clean be .
so , to find these 80 percent to reach , have to the developed world , including these countries like china , their <unk> completely <unk> .
the other note she says , whether we the <unk> technology using forces , if you in all the developed countries used is , and we on the way are , you to the the rest to get .
that 's great important .
this is a <unk> this <unk> .
if we from there go back , how should that by 2020 as testament to look like ?
it should be back the two elements in them .

but actually is this note for the things that we companies that do n't completely to the big , <unk> lead , just the same , or even something less important as the other , which the strength , the innovation for this amazing breakthroughs that represents .
this amazing breakthroughs , we must with <unk> track and that we can measure : in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there 's many great books to this subject .
that al gore 's book `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> `` <unk> amount of energy <unk> the stuff all about the air . ''
they go it really through and create a frame , in the top of this wide , discussing can be , because we need to offer assistance from all sides .
there 's a few things , that come together to worry .
this is a request .
a very much more specific wish that we keep this technology making up .
if they told me just a wish for the next 50 years from now , i could the president to choose , a telephone lasts , and that i loved her , i could have this desire to vote , the projection is , <unk> <unk> without the co2 is being invented . you this desire to take , i .
this has the biggest impact .
if we 've got this desire to do n't want to get there to the dig in between the long and are those are continuing with people , awful potential to , between the u.s. and china , between the poor and rich countries . and almost all life of these two billion neurons are very much worse be .
what we need to so i do ?
for which means for <unk> i ?
we need to us for more the context of those same .
if countries , it’s in places like <unk> meet , they should not just about carbon to talk .


we need to spread the message .

it 's a very important wish , but i think , we can see him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . only to <unk> something better to understand -- first place , they can make us an idea of the scale this investment back to work ?
bill gates : to take the simulation is on a supercomputer order to do , all the great scientist to get , what we 've done , we need them just some 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian nuclear reactor tested have anything to ensure that it is as to work , is you only in the <unk> million .
the difficult to step is that build them the first vessel , another billion find , the <unk> and the place the fact , the first of it builds .
once the first 's done , when he says it 's started as i promised , then everything is that very , because the -- at , the <unk> is so different than with rocketry passion , how we know them .
so to the right to understand : that , and deep in the ground to build almost like a vertical pillar of a nuclear <unk> , this <unk> <unk> and then starting the process , up and works , hard on up to the bottom ?
bg : right . today , they have to the reactor here , let 's putting into your , so there 's many people and lots of control is , the go wrong can . this thing where you want it opens and things influences , or going to bring . that 's not good !
if you , but very cheap fuel , has , you can tell him for 60 years into your -- you think about doing an essential pillar -- that they bury , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's sitting there , and <unk> 60 years long and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , the way to have a solution for the garbage and you will .
bg : yeah . now , what do with the garbage is happening : you can see him sitting , let 's -- there 's much less than waste , with this method -- then they take him and grab him in the next reactor and burn it on .
and we start , by we the garbage can take , the already exists , the in these <unk> or <unk> the homes reactors is very much . this is our <unk> .
so is that , which for these reactors operate a problem was , that , what we in our fill and so that is that <unk> dramatically reduce that during this process .
but while you with different people that world of educational opportunities that we 've talked ,
where is the biggest interest , so what really to implement ?
bg : well , we have us still not on a place where particles are and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is wearing . there 's big interest and the people with the computer company , were in russia , india , china -- when i was here and what you have the minister of hit and talking about it , like this to the <unk> fit .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction done .
this is a variation in a thing , that was taken .
this is a crucial step forward , but it 's like a faster the reactor and some countries have this built , why is everybody , the a rapid reactor , it has eventually , a <unk> for our first .
in their idea : <unk> and the probability that was going to really launched in to shout out ?
bg : well , we need one of these <unk> , <unk> things that are very cheap , are , we have 20 years , to innovate and then 20 years , to use these .
that 's like one of the deadline , the us the <unk> to see this has a , we <unk> have to .
and , you know , <unk> , if anything good country on , and this is becoming a desire , would that easy to hold .
and fortunately , there 's now , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of these little , it said , when their new approaches to work , the funding for your pilot works , for it <unk> can .
and it would be the most , if it 's several create , since then you could be a mixture of use .
anyway , we will need a solution .
of what the the big kinds of major breakthroughs , is this the biggest , that you know ?
bg : a <unk> like this is announcing .
that it would also , without the <unk> been , but that makes it 's still so much more .
in a nuclear sector , there 's another , innovative companies .
you know , we know the work not as well , like this , but there 's the <unk> method , that 's a other way things .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which is something very difficult it seems , but you might say that that about us .
and be there 's different , but the beauty of it 's , they thought <unk> a million times as much energy has a bit like , we say , a <unk> and therefore , if you with the problems can deal , and that are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost ran in your own league table .
if that does n't , then what ?
we need to <unk> need them , in order to try to the <unk> stable enough to balance ?
bg : if you in this situation is coming , it 's as if you to be much eating it has , and just before faced with a heart attack is do . what do you then ? you need to maybe a <unk> or anything like .
there 's a <unk> the road , <unk> called , the road , with various techniques , such as anything to the warming continues to delay , so that we 20 or 30 years longer '' had gone to us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you for is that we keep this is n't need .
some people say , you should n't look at first tunnels , the insurance to work , because a that might be lazy power , so that you on , eats , because you know that a the <unk> save will .
i do n't know if that 's smart , is , if you 're wondering , the importance of this problem , in front of eyes , leads , but there 's now a larger discourse in <unk> about , if you that 's available to have to match , if we have the things faster come , or this innovation longer need , when we expect .
change deniers like , you have a or two sentences for the space to you might want to convince them ?
bg : well , unfortunately , live in the skeptics in very different kinds of bully .
the ones , the scientific arguments do , are very little bit .
they say , that 's negative effects , there , the with the clouds to do have to the things to move that ?
there 's very , very few things that do you even tell you can , of which it 's an opportunity in a million there .
that <unk> here 's like those with aids .
you what makes the mistake now , and you pay for this very much later .
and why is the idea , now , if you all kinds of compiled problems has , in something to invest , any of the you only later , which has -- and that energy coming out that the investment , not that 's clear . actually is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst case scenario and there 's people in the rich world , the road , ipcc look and say , okay , that 's no big drama .
the fact is that that 's uncertainty of us to have the supposed to do .
but my dream of this is this is that , if you put it economic and i can do , and , at the co2 cleaned , then also say the skeptics , `` okay , it 's interested me to do n't realize that 's no carbon <unk> , i wish i almost recognize that it did that , but i 'm it probably never accept , because it 's cheaper than the previous one way . ''
and that would be your answer on the <unk> <unk> argument , they said , if you all this time and energy is used to find the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals <unk> suffering , the <unk> , that we face of malaria and so on that it is a stupid waste of resources , is , money for it to invest , while it better stuff there , that we can do .
bg : well , the actual spending for the research -- we say the u.s. , be 10 billion per year , more to spend when they do today -- that 's not so dramatically .
<unk> to treat other things not suffer .
you then it comes to big <unk> , and here we can bring sensible people these , to having something has , that does n't have economic growth is , and trying to the to finance . for me is going on the most of waste .
that it was because , you is very briefly a paradox <unk> and funded by the only still the learning curve . i think we should be more things are trying to the the potential to have , very much cheaper to be .
if we have the <unk> , the you get , a very high <unk> is , then you can only the rich , keep up .
i mean , each of us here i could take five times as much for our energy on this thing without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> , you think anybody .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research , not more been talking about ? ''
he will still , because of his earlier stories , based <unk> associated , but he has understood why that a very rare group is and so , which brings he now that <unk> .
and that 's a <unk> , the i for the appropriate that i think .
the research , it 's just nuts , how little the supported by 2027 .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope , that your desire and she 's going . you very , thank you .
bg : thanks .
some years ago , here at ted , turned peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is quite simple . <unk> have to the lays out <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , i think about . <unk> tape , i think about . <unk> thread , and a marshmallow , building .
the marshmallow have to on top . be .
and , though it really just seems , it 's actually get really hard , because it people are pushing very quickly work together .
and so i thought , that at an interesting idea is that i and it in a <unk> turns into .
it was a huge success .
since i spent about 70 workshops world 's done , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there 's something about doing this task , what the depth of some insights in the nature of the cooperation across the technologies and i want some of them to share with you .
we tend to start to the most people , and of diversity in the task to orient .
you talk about , they start thinking , how it will look , they <unk> to try power ,
then we invest , you a little time in planning and organization . they <unk> and put <unk> from .
they invest in a majority of their time in the able to build the time <unk> structures
and finally , just before they were no time more have to take someone the marshmallow and they put him gently down on the top , pop into a step back and `` <unk> '' ! we admire them their work .
what but then , almost always , there 's been saying that `` <unk> '' to a `` <unk> '' is , because the spot the marshmallow is causing , that the whole thing , it’s just how and <unk> .
there 's a series of people , the very much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have more than others , and under the worst enemies are totally fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make something really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there 's also a team that much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have and under the best are totally fresh alumni of making this kindergarten .
and this is quite astonishing .
like us , peter told to produce them not just the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask yourself to is : how is that ? why , what about where ?
and peter 's telling : `` none of kids spend on time in it 's head of the <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they invest , no time in <unk> .
there 's but still one more reason .
and it 's this , that mba students get trained were , the a right plan to find , ok !
and it and then to realize .
then what happens , if you the marshmallow book on the top of profanity , they have no time more and what happened ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> do differently , is that they do with the marshmallow start and prototypes to build , successful prototypes , always with the marshmallow , among the top , so that you times during the opportunity to have <unk> prototypes to fix .
<unk> recognize this kind of the collaboration as a core of a <unk> <unk> .
and with every attempt to get the kids right across the feedback , what works and what do n't .
so is the performance , with prototypes to work , you much -- but we see again , how other teams operate .
the average for the most impact is at about . <unk> , mba students to create a half of that , lawyers do something more , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is at the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately , .
<unk> is the ultimate , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles , understanding and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to try and stable structures to build .
ceos are at something about the average . but here is it 's interesting .
knowledge of you a <unk> administrator on the team , you going to dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you see , hard to try and realize , `` this team will win . ''
you can the predictions . why it work ?
because they particular skills of the <unk> have .
they run the process , they understand him .
and it 's one that team that <unk> and on the work to pay attention is the performance of you are teams dramatically improving .
<unk> skills and <unk> and their combination of lead to succeed .
if you 10 teams have to the typical will do , get you ca . six , the robust structures made .
i tried to ask , something very fascinating .
i thought , we bring the <unk> same .

what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
and so this happened . not a team had a robust structure .
it , if someone 's a <unk> high construction , built have said , he have the price , looking at home by her .
it 's so not interesting is that high <unk> a strong effect of ?
we repeated this exercise with the same part of students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood you the advantage of resources , `` <unk> . ''
so it was from the same animal , bad team of the computer under the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least of time .
there 's so they do <unk> lessons for us , over the nature of the incentive and success .
you might ask : why would anyone in fact that time to invest in a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and processes to make them to evaluate their teams to help , cars , video and `` <unk> <unk> '' to make it .
and what the <unk> does is to help them hidden assumptions to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge and offers a shared experience , a common language , '' or . ethos , the right prototype to build .
and this is the value of this experience , this is so easy to practice .
and those of them , that 's interested , can <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see on how to the marshmallow is building .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find a crazy examples from all the world , how people , the system to optimize and <unk> .
there 's also , <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i believe is , the construction , actually a <unk> sports is .
it demands , that we all our senses , on the task to be aware and that we keep our thinking optimal use , how our feelings and our do , in the challenge , the front of us is very much .
and sometimes is a small prototype this experience anything , what it needs to us from a `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' moment to earth .
and that can a big difference do .
thank you .
we doing so when we would have here 's a machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a time machine .
and everybody in this room has to skeletal muscle .
and you can in the past , go , you can in the future go ; they can not in here and now to remain ,
and i wonder , what they vote would , because i my friends in a lot lately asked this question of have , and they wanted everybody in the past , go .
i do n't know . they were interested in the time back , before it cars , there or twitter or `` america 's looking for the american idol '' .
i do n't know .
i 'm confident that you kind to the nostalgia , to <unk> drawn is .
and that i do know .
i 'm not part of the group , i must say .
i do n't want in the past , and that 's not , because i was a explorers i 'm --
it 's because it reminds me , and options on this planet does n't go back , you go forward .
i want so in this machine , and i want in the future go .
this is the greatest time , that 's ever attempted on this planet , there , whatever , the kinds of scale them on the page : health , wealth , mobility , the opportunities , declining <unk> .
it there 's ever been a time , like this .
my <unk> died of all when they had 60 were .
my grandparents urged this number on 70 .
my parents are the 80 on the into iraq .
there should so much better a nine the beginning of my <unk> look .
but it ca n't time to hire people like us , because this is a bigger one thing than that .
a kid , that today in delhi born , it you can expect , so long to live as the richest man on the world , 100 years ago .
you think this question . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is n't that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox would have a billion people on this planet killed .
they have the demographics of earth on a way forward to being formed , how it 's no war , ever managed by .
they 're way . they 're gone .
we have you <unk> . pfft .
in the rich world exists disease , the millions of us ago , just one generation is still under threat to have , very little still .
<unk> , <unk> , polio ...
i know all was still have someone , which is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability , billion people to feed , that are the successes the scientific method .
and my view , is the scientific method , things out , look , if it works , it change , if it does n't that does , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately , that 's already there is the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were often mentioned ,
and one of it is that , despite all our greatest achievements a billion people on this world every day hungry , to bed , go .
this number drops , and they are rising very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and not only that , we have our imagination that we were used to this world that we had to your choice .
drinking water , <unk> country , the rainforests , oil , gas : they disappear world , which was soon , and if we have not from this chaos <unk> myself , we also .
the question is so : we can do that ? i think it is .
i think it 's clear that we food can produce , the billion people feed is , without the country , like an they live , to rape her .
i think , we can this world with energy to feed that they do n't look at the destroyed .
i think that really , and no , this is not <unk> .
but this is me holding me at night , wake up -- one of the things that 's made me at night , wake up to hold . we have the science progress still never been so she really needed like now , still never ,
and we were also still never appeared in an opportunity to him as to <unk> , just as we it today can .
we 're clinging to the threshold to an amazing , amazing events on many areas . and yet , i think , really , that we are hundreds , 300 years ago , the enlightenment , go back to guess which to a time to find , in the we progress , so there have , in the way we think about these things <unk> <unk> have to with more found myself as now .
the people putting the road , in their think the world , which is so closely , that you do n't you free of fractals .
not time the truth will you free ourselves .
and they stop , everybody has a right on my opinion , ; even a right on my opinion , to the progress ,
but you know , you see where they were no right to have ?
they have no right on their own facts . <unk> , you have n't .
and i have a while you needed to knock that out .
ago about a decade , i have a paper about , vaccination , for `` the new yorker , '' written , a little paper .
and i was amazed , on the resistance to run into , on the resistance to engage at the fact , what the end of the most effective activity , in health in history of humanity 's .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did just what i always do them , i wrote a paper and drive the job .
and soon after that i wrote a paper about <unk> changed , food .
the same thing , only bigger .
the people who played a crazy .
so i 've also about a articles written , and i could n't understand why the people thought , that would `` <unk> '' , why they believed that molecules on a certain kind of what is a random jumble of what they move your a <unk> on the area of nature was .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the articles , i did on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we type , we pass a , we go food , that 's okay .
but these articles -- made me worried , and i could n't figure out , why , and finally , i found it turns out .
and that 's because of it was that these <unk> , made me nuts were doing it does anyone who does n't <unk> were .
that were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that got me so much mess that ...
but then i thought , you know what to be too we 're honest :
we 're clinging to a point where to with the the we 're not just the same relationship to the progress we have how early .
we 're talking <unk> of them .
we 're talking ironic of them , with a little quotes about the fact , `` progress . ''
okay , for that there 's reasons , and i think we know , which the reasons that are .
we have this faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science is , if you 've lost , and there 's no reason , why that 's not that should be .
you can just a couple of names we call , and the people will understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , of mass , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can their own list your vote .
there 's ask , and problems with the people , of which we believed that they always right have done . and be so they are skeptical .
imagine them questions that urge you evidence to urge you some evidence .
they take nothing more than any given to myself .
but now here 's : if you evidence to get to get you this evidence to assume , and in that we are not good .
and i can that 's from the reason to say , that we now in an epidemic of the fear for life , as i they still never seen , to have and hopefully will never see again , let me .
ago about 12 years was a story posted , a terrible story that the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine appeared in the connection to paint .
very scary .
tons of studies have been done , to see if that was true .
tons of studies we should be conducted ; that 's a serious .
the data came to take them .
the data came in , from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no significant correlation , no link , who does n't .
it makes no difference . it makes no difference , because we hold of anecdotes that we think , we think , what we see , what we 're going to see to believe what does the , that we will actually really feel .
we think we do n't want to see a bunch documents from a <unk> , the us data , there , and i understand that , i think , you do that we all .
but you know what ?
the outcome of it was a catastrophic ,
catastrophic , because of this fact : the u.s. is one of the single countries in the world , in the top of the immunization for <unk> goes down .
that 's absolutely scandalous and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
what 's happening , that we do that could .
now , i understand that . the reason i 'm .
because it has anybody here <unk> ?
has a only company in the audience ever gets a little , <unk> die see ?
what happens is not very often .
what happens in this country do n't actually , but the 160,000 time on the world in the last year .
that are many deaths , by <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not happening here is , we make this <unk> , and people like jenny mccarthy , we can walk around and the messages of fear and illiteracy of the platforms like the oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that they can do , because they cause and correlation should not connecting .
they do n't understand that these things , we 'll seem to be , but almost never just the same conclusion .
and that 's something that we need to learn world , which is very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk institute .
he was liberated us from one of the worst <unk> of humanity .
not afraid , no moons , polio , pfft , gone .
the guy in the middle , not as a lot .
he called `` paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people a <unk> developed .
he can the life of <unk> , 500,000 in children per year in the developing to save .
pretty well , not ?
so , that 's good , besides some of this , that paul <unk> and over the vaccines , talks , and says , how valuable they are , and that the people just stop that come to complain .
and that says he actually so .
paul 's so a terrorist .
if paul in a public <unk> talks , he ca n't without being armed on one particular story that .
he gets calls home , because the people to something like to tell you to know where his kids going to school .
and why ? because paul wrote a vaccine against has done .
i need this is n't say , but vaccines are essential .
we know , you take it continues to return to the disease , back , terrible disease , and that 's happening now .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and this is worse , and pretty soon be children back of it was dying , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they will not just have to <unk> die .
what is with the polio this ? we take that . why not ?
a <unk> of me has to me ago , a few weeks , writing and told you think all i 'm a little to <unk> .
nobody has that ever said before .
they would their kid 's not against polio vaccinate everyone . on is no way .
subtle .
why ? because we could n't see polio this year . and you know what ?
we had in this country , who was no polio virus .
now , i do n't know , maybe i went from now this morning , someone in lagos , a plane and it flies has just after we go to los angeles , the moment he is about ohio .
and in a few hours , goes , he and <unk> a car , and he comes after a long beach , and he 's going into one of <unk> <unk> tonight is to visit .
and he does n't know that he 's with a <unk> disease that 's convinced that is , and we know that 's also not , because that 's actually the world now time .
this is the planet , like an we live . do n't you so , as if he did n't that 's .
we love it , us in a lie to membrane . we love that .
you have today morning everybody their supply vitamins taken ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you on the thing you can help .
i know that they did that have , because half the americans , that every day , power .
you take this stuff , and they take an alternative to cure , and it makes no difference , how often we find out , that they 're useless people are .
the data to verify that the time .
they <unk> their urine . do more they almost never .
that 's okay , they want to be in 28 billion dollars to the dark , urine numbers .
i agree with them completely to .
a dark , urine . dark .
why we doing this ? why we doing this ?
now , i think , i understand -- we hate the industry , .
we hate each one to a strong government . we have n't trust the solar system .
and that we should also not . our healthcare system is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> ourselves to us , that it happen can afford .
we walk , so before that way , and where we walk , we ?
we walk in the poor the <unk> .
that 's great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that 's really a serious , because this stuff is crap , and we give a billion dollars for from .
and i 've all kinds of little tour through some here .
this does n't of them -- <unk> , -- was , <unk> , -- was , <unk> , because i actually do n't time , what this is , but we give a billion dollars for it looks like , it 's -- was .
and you know what ? when i think that i say , shouting at me the people end , i say , `` what looks after it hits you ? let the people , but we do , what they want .
so you feel politics . well . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
because it me , whatever is , whether it 's the minister is , the saying , `` hmm , i 'm going to the some evidence of my research says to mammography does n't suppose '' or make any <unk> , the his patients with <unk> treat want .
if you now , there are in this way to completely , where i think , and magic some evidence and science to replace , i could get them to a place to with the characteristics they do n't want to be .
they will get to <unk> <unk> in south africa .
he got there have its people to present , because he said that he insisted , that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more effective than any antiretroviral drugs are , of which we know that you can to the course of aids , the brakes when you can .
hundreds <unk> deaths in a country , the worse than any other of this disease <unk> will .
you tell me , please do n't that these things not a consequence of view .
the have you . that you have always .

this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , and over the metaphor .
that 's anti-israeli ideology , not science .
everything , what we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , everybody <unk> , was from the people changed .
you know , there 's certainly not <unk> in the garden .
there 's certainly not <unk> .
there 's been no christmas . we have this all done .
we have it in the last 11,000 years done .
and some of this has n't work and some of it 's not .
we 're getting rid , what does n't work has .
now we can it 's take a profession . and of course there 's the risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , do , and this stuff can million people to help , million people , their lives to extend .
that you want to do n't do ?
i must say , that now i do n't .
we refuse <unk> changed the food feet .
why we do that ?
now , what i 'm always hear is : to a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we want not a huge areas of with one thing , that 's wrong .
we want to do n't realize that companies who live and patent .
we want to do n't realize that companies seeds have them .
and so you know what my answer on all this is ?
yes , they 've been right . fix that we that .
it 's true , we have a huge <unk> , but that 's not science .
that has with science and nothing to do .
it 's right , moral , <unk> .
you know that the science is not a company is .
you is no country .
you is not time an idea ; they 's a process .
you is a process , and sometimes work , he and sometimes not , but the idea that we of science , not allow you should , their work to do , because we 're afraid of this is a real dead end , and they 're holding millions of people from human flourishing to leave .
you know , in the next 50 years , we going to 70 percent more growing food to disclose than the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we give you what it 's not .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we want people do n't yet empowered , this <unk> stuff to eat , like for example <unk> .
<unk> is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a bunch calories . it 's miserable .
it has n't require nutrients , it has not a protein , and scientists building this is all right now , it has a .
and then we could the people that food and would n't be blind be .
they would n't starving , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything , what i 'm trying to tell you can do is : why they fight , we that ?
i mean , we ask : why they fight , we that ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about , gene move your . it 's not about to throw chemicals .

it 's not about , to a rice <unk> , it 's about , people at the life to get , and it is highest time , to understand what that means .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do this , if we so on doing as far do we set of something guilty , off the the we , i believe , not guilty want to be , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other description for that , what happened here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our not worthy , and we need to that really going to stop .
after this incredible funny , entertainment , you want to be that might say , `` will you still in this ridiculous machine , and in the future go ? ''
anyway , . that what i want , so this .
the moment is written them in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can this machine , on all imagine , what we want .
we can you 're moving , where we they 're moving want , and we 're going to you get there are moving , where we want .
we need to those conversations that lead , and we must have to think , but if we in the machine , go up and in the future go we will be happy to be , that made to have .
i know that we do it can , and as far it me in terms like this is something , what the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
since some time i 've come for the <unk> . it may seem strange to appear to continue to acquire a magician interested in that , that it was because , you look at it just as i , as `` a deception , the to something real laughs are going , if someone just 're , enough that anybody believes . ''
with other words , <unk> have in some studies have a measurable effect shown , the <unk> world , which is just therefore , because the person thinks that even with her happening , she was a pharmaceutical or a kind of ... in <unk> , the example , there 's , if the patient 's just 're , enough that anybody thinks , a measurable effect of the body , that you the <unk> called .
a delusion is going to something real laughs , because somebody 's so we 're walking around .
so that we meet each also understanding , i want you now a the basic , very simple trick to show .
and i 'll show you , how he works . this is a trick , the least , since the 1950s , in every <unk> for children 's axiomatic .
i even have taught him from <unk> <unk> magic of the <unk> in the 1970s , learned .
i 'm going to him for you carry out and it and then you explain .
and then i 'm going to explain why i want it 'll explain .
so , you see , what happens .
that knife , that they 're analyzing can ; my hand , that they 're analyzing can .
i 'm going to the knife , just so in my went off to hold .
i <unk> my sleeve , back .
and if to ensure that she 's nothing in my sleeve , go away , or from him out later , i 'll just my wrist on right here <unk> .
on this way they can see that , hard to none of time you end of moving . unless i 'm here <unk> , nothing can in my sleeve , as it or turn out .
and the goal , man 's very simple .
i 'm going to my hand , open , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is that knife by my bare physical <unk> lasted .
it 's sitting in fact , so they 're , to modify its place that i do it shake it can , without that the knife <unk> .
nothing goes into in my sleeve , or it comes out , no <unk> . and you can all study .
<unk> !

probably know many of you here in the room watching this trick .
he works so , this :
i hold the knife in my hand .
i say that i do my wrist <unk> which to ensure that she 's nothing in my sleeve , go away , or out later , and that 's a lie .
the reason , why i my wrist <unk> , is the , in that , this is the real secret of the illusion of sand .
in the moment , which is , where i mean by hand of you <unk> , so they can you of the back to see , moving to acquire this one finger and here , my <unk> , just from there , where it was , in a position , in the he 'd like this extended is .
really wonderful trick ?
back there 's sitting on someone , the not a childhood had .
so , he is supposed to start to here . right .
and if i told me <unk> , changing the hands on its position .
and now you could talk about , why that a delusion is , why you do n't have facial , that down here just three fingers to see are : because the mind and the way , how he received it comes out of , they 're not one by counting , one , two , three , but you as a group can see .
but it 's about now here 's not actually . and then i open , i mean by hand .
of course it go there would have no , but not by the <unk> my body , but through a trick , through my <unk> , the right now there is .
and when i mean by hand , let me , that on the same thing , by , what i <unk> , going through this movement hidden in the war and special little , again <unk> .
i guess these hand away . and there is the knife .
this secret trick , they can your friends and i used to demonstrate . thanks .
now , which has this with the <unk> to do ?
a year ago , or so , i read a study , that i 'm really right away by walking .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and why was that for me an amazing thing .
it , which , which is that 's what turned out : if you a <unk> in the form a white ball and offer , in the form of a <unk> , like this is just a round , white pill , the a period of measurable effect of mind .
but if you the shape , in the you that <unk> feeding , for instance , in a smaller pill to change , and these blue dyed , and a letter after that <unk> , is they actually , measurable , an effective .
and that , though , no matter of any kind of pharmaceutical ... it are just have <unk> .
but a white ball is not as well as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really weird freak .
it turned the road , but out that this is still not everything is .
if you capsules take , the people are still more effective than and lots of every form .
a colored the capsule , the edges of a end of yellow and the other end red is , is better than a white capsule .
also the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day 's not as well as three pills -- and i ca now , not respond to the exact statistics , remember . i do , i 'm sorry .
the really , but is , ...
... that 's also the <unk> play a role .
and the shape who plays a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to conclude , you must have to the needle to reach .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance , that you a patient <unk> .
that creates a very strong image in mind . that 's very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is actually — i 'm going to you in a different time to show , if we have a <unk> have .
the fact , so this is that the white ball and not as well , and so it looks like the blue pill , the not as well , and so it looks like a time capsule that did not as well , and so it looks like the needle .
and nothing in it has any really have pharmaceutical property . it 's only our believe that sort of the in us a greater impact achieved .
i wanted to know that i do this idea for a magic trick use could .
i suspect something that obviously a delusion is , and i 'll let 's real quick look .
we know , yes , from 's when the study , that you to the needle to grab , if it on the thing to go to decide .
this is an 18 inch long <unk> . she 's very , <unk> . and i 'm going to you first a little bit to render time .
is this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is at my skin . that 's no special effect of hollywood .
i 'm now this needle in my skin , stick and through them are pushing , until you to the other side bounce back <unk> .

i propose , so ago , if you very quickly , and evil is , then you looking for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm going to the first <unk> part of this is the back to do .
you can it 'll see in , you can but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it goes , so , right here , where my meat starts , at the bottom part of my <unk> , i 'm just a little <unk> do .
does me really sorry . makes you this crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and on the other side that way back out .
now we 're actually in the same situation , that we do the <unk> had .
about .
but now they can my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , when i do you show you . that 's a , two , three , four , five .
well , yeah ,
i know , what the people think , if you can see that .
they say , `` okay , the 's when you are not so stupid and <unk> , and of the skin , only to us a few minutes long to be entertained . ''
now , then i 'm it to show you .
look like this one of ? pretty good .
yes , i know .
and the people in the back to say , `` okay . i think that 's not right seen . ''
the people in the <unk> come from now , pure .
you make it me give them from the close to show .
this is really my skin . that 's no special effect of hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can that 's swivel around .
i do , i 'm sorry . if you an evil is , look at the way , look at not to myself .
the people in the back or the shift , that later , eventually , on video to see how will say , `` well , yes , that it : yeah , pretty impressive , however , but if it really must be saying , would he -- you see , here 's a hole and there , if it becomes real life would , would it bleed . ''
okay , , let me a little blood for you <unk> .
yes , here is it .
normally would i now the needle take too .
i would my arm an oil and show you realize that there is not the wounds are .
but i think , in this frame , here , and with the intention , from a delusion is something real to do , i 'm going to the needle just in there 's , and so from the stage to go .
we 're going to us in the next days , another couple of time to face .
i hope that you 'll be wondering , already on this . thank you .
everybody talks about today about that happiness .
i have some people the number of books , if you just let 's a , with `` <unk> '' in the title , in the last five years published by virtue and they gave after about 40 on , and there 's certainly still much more .
there 's a massive wave of nuclear power of interest to any luck under the explorers .
there 's very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people i have been doing .
but despite all of that flood of work , there 's several different cognitive fall , that 's like , you almost impossible make , clear about happiness thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive fall into action .
this is for reporter , the of their own happiness is think , and it is true for scientists , the of happiness is think that , because it turns out that we so just mess that are like each other .
the first of these fall , is a <unk> , complexity , admitting this .
it turns , totally out that the word `` happiness is simply not a useful in the word , more is , because we do it on to many different things to apply them .
i think , there 's a particular meaning , on the we do it <unk> could , but in the great and around like this is something that we knew i have to be , and we 're going to the complicated , which you do think to have to achieve that , what well-being is .
the second case i guess it uses of of experience and various things : in basically consists of them between be happy in his life and be happy about to be living or happy with his life .
and this are two very different concepts , and they 're both <unk> in the an idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and this is the unfortunate fact that we 're not about a situation that 's think we can , the well-being that affects , without its importance to warp .
i mean , this is a real cognitive and trap .
there 's simply no way , it right , '' to get .

and then i added he 's add , really quite emotionally , that has the whole experience was ruined .
but that did n't .
what it ruined had were the memories , among the experience .
he had the experience a little better .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had stage .
they <unk> not , because he with a memory <unk> was ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was all , what he goes to keep getting had .
what makes us that actually says this is that we about us and over the other people to think we could it in terms of two types of anger itself .
there 's a <unk> itself , that in the present to live and the present us know , is able to the past , back to experience , but in basically just the presence has .
it 's the <unk> itself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor , asks : `` does it now it hurts , when i do you here <unk> ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> itself , and that <unk> itself is that , that <unk> and the story of our lives upright , left , and it 's <unk> , that the doctor 's been an by he the question turns out , `` how they 've been wondering , in his last time i felt like ? ''
or `` how was their journey over to albania ? '' or a similar .
this are two very different entities , that <unk> ourselves and that <unk> itself , and the wonderful to confuse this is part of the <unk> '' of exploring this from happiness .
so , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that starts really begin with a basic reaction on our memories of lawsuits -- it begins immediately , together .
we tell you 're not only stories , if we do it seemed to do , stories to tell .

and let them <unk> with an example start .
there 's an old one study .
that are real patients , the road , a painful procedure participate in .
i 'm not going into the really go . you today is not more painful , yet it was painful , as this study the 1990s , and did was .
they were asked , all of 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and here are two patients . that are your records .
and they 're often wondered : `` who from both has more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
patient to b has a clear thought , i suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , had had a patient to b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : `` how very thought that these patients , that you suffered ? ''
and here 's a surprise :
and the surprise is , the patient is a , a lot <unk> <unk> the day of <unk> had as a patient to b .
the stories of <unk> were different ways , and because a very one big part of the story is , how they turned out --
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one of them is this shows you ...
but one of them is clearly , even worse than the other .
and the , the worse is was the , where the pain , very the end on its peak of self . it 's a very bad history .
so where we know that ?
because we all these people after their <unk> ask you have , and also much later , `` how bad was the whole thing in general ? `` well ,
and they was much worse for a , as for a b in the <unk> .
so , that 's a direct conflict between the the <unk> ourselves and the the <unk> itself .
of view of making <unk> even had to b , clearly a <unk> time .

this is that to lead to say that the patient is suffering , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you that a few minutes long has power you 're dominated by saying that <unk> themselves from the patient is a , worse , has done is , and you has dominated by saying that <unk> themselves from the patient is a , much better has done is , because now , you have the patient is a , a better story about his experience , given .
what defines ooh , a story from ?
and this is for the stories that the memory of us of visualizing and it is true , neither the stories that we invent .
what defines , a story <unk> are these cases , significant moments , and the end .

so , that <unk> itself alive to be living in continuously .
it has moments of making <unk> which , after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're for always been lost .
i mean , the most moments of our lives -- and i do that it so -- you know , the psychological present is true than about three seconds long . which means , you know that it comes in a life about 600 million of that there . in a month there 's about 600,000 times . the most of you leave no lane .
the most of you are completely ignored , from <unk> itself .
and yet you 'll get kind of the sense that they had that should be that what during these moments of making <unk> happens in our lives is .
it 's the limited resource , that we use , as we 're on this world are .
and how we they say they would seem to be important , but that 's not the story that the <unk> even for us , you keep .
so we do this <unk> ourselves and that <unk> itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the 's interacting with time .
of view of making <unk> itself , if you a vacation might have and the second one week , just so good is how the first , then is the <unk> vacation twice as well as the <unk> vacation .
so does it work not for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation 's hard to better than the <unk> 's somewhere , because there is no new memories , which i 'd be .
they have the story does n't changed .
and on this way is time actually the critical variable that takes a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> itself . time has very little difference on this story .
so , that <unk> itself is doing more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually <unk> , that choice is true , because if you a patient who have to the , we say , two <unk> at two different kinds of surgeons did and to start to decide , which then he would choose to decide , then is the , the votes , the ran the memory and eventually , the less bad , is , and this is the surgeon , the winner selected will get .
that <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .

and even if we respond to the future thinking , we think that sort of our future n't normally when experiences .
we think about our future has been , as <unk> memories .
but basically , you can imagine that at , you know , as a tyranny of making <unk> itself , and you can range , that <unk> even think more than one that looks like , you that <unk> even <unk> through experience , the that <unk> themselves do n't need .
i have the sense that if we vacation might do this very often the case is , that is , we make a vacation largely sitting in a little bottle of making <unk> itself .
and that 's a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , like a very <unk> we of our memories ?
this is a result of explanations , the for the dominance of making <unk> even gave you will .
and when i think about it , i think you go to a vacation , the we ago , a few years in antarctica . 've done , the clearly the best vacation was , the i 've ever had had , and i think a quite often . that in the relationship to tell us , how often i 'm able to other <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory back to that <unk> journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes long , in the last four years <unk> .
now , when i ever since the folder open , would have with the 600 million pictures in that , i would have another one hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are its peak half hours .
because it seems a disagreement , to do .

so i want you to talk about a thought experiment to think .
imagine , you want their next vacation time ago , you know that out for the <unk> all their pictures <unk> be and they get a <unk> drug , so that you by , nothing to remind you will .
now , they would the same vacation and vote ?
and if you a other vacation and vote would , there a conflict between your two types of anger itself , and they have to think about , as you this conflict to decide , and that 's really do n't actually , obviously , because if you in the sense of time thinking , you 'll get an answer . and if you in the sense of memories are thinking could you one another answer to get .
why we the <unk> choose , that we chose this is a problem , the road , we give it turns out with a choice between the two types of anger itself .
now , the two types of anger itself 's have two words on from happiness exists on .
there 's actually two concepts , from happiness , that we can apply to one of per product itself .
so they can ask : how happy , is that <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how happy there are those moments in spite of making <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- luckily for those moments , is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions , the measured it can be ?
and , either way , we 're now we 're able to a pretty good idea to get from happiness in the space <unk> ourselves over the time .
if you after the lucky ones toward the <unk> yourself questions , it 's a very different thing .
this is not about of them , as happy one person who lives .
it is is of them , how great satisfaction or close up the person is , if this person about their lives , come to think .
very different forms onto the .
everybody , the those terms n't really different is that exploration of the happiness <unk> , and i belong to a lot of researchers about comfort , the the exploration of the happiness have just blew have on exactly that way .
the distinction between the the lucky ones toward the <unk> ourselves and the average happiness in the space <unk> itself is in recent years in people 's been , and now an effort you , it turns out the two <unk> to measure .

in recent years have so , we started , about happiness . the two types of anger itself to learn .
and and the main thing that you , that we , i believe , we 've learned this is that they really very different .
you can know , how about being someone with his life is , and that teaches you really not a lot about , as happy , he gets to live lives and vice versa .
just to make them a sense of the correlation to convey , the correlation is about <unk> .
what that means is that , if you know someone would meet and you would tell you , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about its size of knowledge ?
now , it would be something about his greatness know , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell them that someone be life than eight on a scale from 10 <unk> has you have much uncertainty about , as happy , he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about that . the average happiness in the space <unk> when you are .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness , mainly mean , very pleased to be with people , that we like , time to spend with people , that we 'd like .
there 's another , pleasure , but that 's dominant .
so if you that happiness , the two types of anger itself to maximize that we want you going to the end very different things to do .
the implication of nowhere , what i 'm here said , to have this is that we been fortunate to really not imagine you should be as a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely , another term .
now , very quickly , a another reason , out of that we 're not clear about happiness is think we can this is that we 're not on the same things to pay attention when we talk about the life thinking , and if we actually life .
so if you the simple question to ask , as happy the people in california are you will not the correct answer to get .
if you ask this question you think that the indus people in california to be happier to , if you , we say , in ohio state in .
and what happens is that , if you about that live in california to think , you think that sort of the difference between california , and other places , and that difference is made , we say , in climate .
well , it turns , totally out that climate is not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful itself , that decide , as happy people are .
now , but , because the thoughtful itself is responsible , they can see the end -- some people could the end , sort of california off to .
and it 's like , you interesting to track , what happens with people , the path , california , pull in the hope , more happy to be .
now , her <unk> themselves will not happy and be .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think you to be happier , are , because if you think about you will admit that reminds you will , how awful the weather in ohio was . and they 're going to feel you to the right decision met .
it 's very difficult , clear about well-being of thinking , and i hope that i gave you a sense of it gives , how hard it 's .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for them .
thank you .
now , when we ago , a few weeks on the phone 've mentioned before them up to me , that 's a pretty interesting result , there , that from this <unk> poll was happening .
like this is something , which is what they us to participate let you can , because they now a few minutes left of ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think there , the most interesting result , that we in the <unk> survey found have is a number of data we absolutely not to find expecting had .
we found that in terms on happiness . '' of <unk> itself .
if what we were watching , like emotion , with the income <unk> .
and it turns , i knew that most under a minimum income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a big a representative sample , under a minimum income of 600,000 dollars in the year .
60,000 years .
dk : 60,000 years .
60,000 dollars in the year are the people getting unhappy , and they are increasingly less happy , ever poorer , they will .
it 's why do we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever do so flat lines seen .
and what happens is obviously , that money , you ca n't have <unk> we bought , but that the lack of money from one certainly the children , we bought , and we can use that the children , very , clear to measure .
it in terms of what the other itself , '' of <unk> itself , you 'll get a different story .

this is true , not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american an effort goes about natural life , freedom , the quest for and happiness .
when people these <unk> take seriously , would , i mean , it seems like everything on the head to ask , everything , what we think , for instance , in terms on <unk> and so forth .
there 's a chance , that politicians , that the country , generally a <unk> like the take seriously , would and that he was based in politics , to make up ?
dk : you know , i believe that 's credit , there for the role of the <unk> in the policy .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but the uk happens when you just and in other countries that happens , they 're now .
the people are the coolest , recognizing that they do so , you 're lucky to think should , if we use , politics , thinking .
it is a while take you , and the people will discuss , if you <unk> exploring those cases , or whether they <unk> exploring those cases , so we need to this debate pretty soon lead .
how you 're lucky to increase can not is very differently depending upon it , as you think and if we use , that <unk> even think , or whether we use , that <unk> even think .
this is politics are shaping , i think , in the next several years .
in the united states <unk> you by , , that <unk> the population to measure .
this is , i think , in the next a or two decades , part of the national statistic always be .
well , it seems to me , this topic is , or should at least it 's the most important political debate took to pursue be over the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane <unk> . i make lots games .

i have a design for . i want more people to convince them , including you all , more time with the play a greater and <unk> games to spend .
now , and we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a whole lot of time for games . ''
maybe something to much time , when you think about how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve this year .

three billion hours per week are n't even close enough to pick the most , problems of the world to solve .
in fact , i 'm confident that , if we have the next century on this planet to survive want , we have this time to dramatically increase to scale .
i 've calculated , we found that required for dinner with about 21 billion hours <unk> per week is very much .
that appears first maybe something <unk> , so again . '' i 's going to make it work today ca : if we have issues like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i believe , we need to try to play online for at least , 21 billion hours per week , through the end of what the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture of -- quite right , why i believe that play , so critical for the survival of the human species in the future are . seriously .
this is a <unk> '' of photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings of the can play catch . so did he ago , the players have a camera put up .
this is one of the classic expressions of the can play .
if you ca n't think are experts , we think , you may at some of nuances in this picture .
and what you probably this sense of the for the urgency , a bit scared , but also the antithesis of concentration , very would one in that solve one of some really difficult to this problem .
if you also play , you see some of nuances . here , the after the top <unk> eyes and the mouths are a sign of the optimism . the eyebrows show surprise .
this is a player , the on the edge of a so-called distilled victory 's axiomatic .
oh , you know that . ok. thought it . so we have some of the player , here .
a <unk> the force is a result , that looked very very positive , this is that they 'd go do n't even knew that it does anyone was possible .
it was kind of almost beyond the imagination .
and if you it with this , they are shocking is , they actually going to something like this can do . this is a <unk> victory .
this player up is just before faced with a distilled the force .
and this is it , what we on millions of their faces of <unk> cities around the world look like to say , if we the hurdles that means that the next century in it had been hurt . the face of those at a , as well , of all odds on the edge of a distilled victory look .
well i , unfortunately , we see more like this face in real life , if we difficult problems to face .
i i call it 's as the `` in life i a bad '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes , ok .
that i am , as i was the `` in life i a bad '' <unk> i do .
this is a graffiti and in my former home in berkeley , california , where i in my ph.d. studying why we in games are better than in real life .
this is a problem , that many of the players have .
we think that we keep in reality not as well , are like in games .
and i mean , not only less succeed , though the tools that we heard .
we reach in <unk> more . i mean well in the connection with the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to the collaboration with each other .

and in reality , if we fail , if we on the barriers to hit , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel defeated correctly . we feel threatened , perhaps most depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in games are there they simply not .
and this is it , what i am a graduate student at is wanted .
why is it in games impossible to think , you could n't just anything to achieve ?
how we can these feelings of the play in the reality is able to ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , despite that the ideals that environment , to put towards a problem solving and you will .
and i have some things of have to the epic wins , in <unk> so possible to do .
so , first , if you in one of these <unk> 're entering , mostly about in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters , that are willing , you a <unk> mission <unk> world , which is immediately .
but not just some mission , but a mission that fit perfectly to her current level of the game that well , right ?
so we do , at this .
they 're getting ever get a task , that you ca n't solve .
but always on the edge of their skills , so they must naturally , too hard . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you , who 's not around and turns <unk> . it 's always very specific and something important to do .
and there 's tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people , the with them work together to knock your very epic journey were going to conclude .
that we have in real life , not so easy , this sense , is that in a <unk> tons of employees are willing to stand .
furthermore , there 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we have come to have .
then we can get this whole positive feedback .
they have is a kind of `` level up '' and `` plus-one strength . '' i heard or `` plus-one intelligence . ''
this constant , feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i do this stage was leaving , i did n't : plus-one talk , and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i 'll take in real life that give feedback , not .
so , the problem of <unk> like the world of warcraft this is that 's like that satisfaction is , any time on the edge of a distilled victory to stand out that we did get our whole time in these <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
until today i 've all , the world you of <unk> together <unk> million years trying to figure , the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
that 's not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but to throw it 's time in context to see ago , i <unk> million years , began our first <unk> tries to go .
the first upright primate and so .
ok , so if we talk about , how much time we now , and with play spend , does that just a sense , whenever you 're wondering , the time in terms on the scale at the human development in front of eyes , holding , what 's extremely is .
but also be appropriate . this because it , totally out that we , by we this whole time getting to play using , in fact that change , to do what we as people in the are able to .
we move to us to collaborative , are continuing , very much beings .
this is the truth . it is that i think .
at once they this interesting about statistics , the recent study of a researcher at the carnegie mellon university was published : the average young man of today in a country with strong <unk> spend some 10,000 hours with <unk> way to the 21st century . <unk> .
so , 10,000 hours , is an extremely interesting number , from two reasons :
first again , for children in the united states are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> that they do in the school to spend , of the five . class of the way to school , and the high school -- if you never been missing .
so we have here 's a complete <unk> , on the young people may also learn , what it means , a good players to be , like anything other , what they school in learning .
and may have some of them the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you know of his theory of nuclear power of success , the theory means that the success of the 10,000 hours .
they are based on the great the research on the <unk> , they said , if we have 10,000 hours with the <unk> my studies of a random the subject matter to the 21st century . <unk> spend , we be able to <unk> in it .
we will be so good at , what do anything that to do , like the most famous people the world .
so , what we have here , is a complete generation of young people , the <unk> are .
the big question is so , `` what i did exactly are the player <unk> good ? ''
because if we that out how could , we would have basically what she 'd never been there <unk> human potential is available to .
so many people have we currently in the world , the least an hour a day with <unk> spend .
this are our <unk> . 500 million people , the information -- well in `` something '' are .
and the next decade we have another one billion players , the information -- well in what do anything that are .
it , if you it 's still do n't have heard ,
the games industry developed <unk> , the energy to save and on <unk> work , instead of the the <unk> , with equal player on the whole world , especially in india , china , brazil , online can play .
you 're expecting an extra one billion player in the next decade .
so that we have total of 1.5 billion player .
and so i started , to start thinking , what it is , what one of us these games to <unk> do .
here are the four things that i found . first , i : <unk> .
ok , imagine , you want that as the extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is that urge , instantly to do something , a barrier to <unk> , together with the believe that we have a <unk> hope kept on success into .
players who think always existed in , they thought <unk> the force is possible , and that it , makes it 's worth , it to try world , which is the same .
players are not sit around .
players are masters in spiders poet of social nets .
there 's a lot more interesting in taking a , to show that we people more like it , after we do with you have played , even if you us evil defeated correctly .
the reason for this is that 's lots of trust it requires , with somebody a game to play .
we have faith focused on that somebody time with us to spend some point that the rules <unk> be out that we i did the goal have and here to the branch and growing by .
so the technologies that interaction between the growing of ties , trust and each other .
as a result of that we build a stronger the social relations on .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason , why the <unk> you of <unk> 22 hours per week he plays , as it as <unk> .
the reason this is that , if we play , we are actually be happier and ted , hard to work , as if we started to relax , or do nothing .
we know that we as human beings , optimal , work , if we make hard , significant work is done .
and the players are always ready , hard to work , if you the right to really get .
and ultimately , very epic , meaning .
players love it , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> proportions , to be .
here 's a <unk> to knock that into the rights of light to the back . you know when you are all of wikipedia , the biggest <unk> the world .
the largest <unk> the world , with nearly 80,000 entries that is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft , in the internet 've been doing as about some very different issue in each other <unk> the world .
they create a very epic story .
they create a very epic source of sharing knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , that are so four superpowers , the to a single product of transformation . players are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it are people , the believe that you as a single change the world can .
and the only problem is that they do believe , you can the virtual worlds are changing , but not the real price .
this is the issue that i 'm going to solve these attempts .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he studied , why people that much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to witness of not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that of people as economist . so he is logical .
and he says ...

so he says , that makes actually make sense , because the player can in <unk> more to get , as in real life .
you can in play a stronger the social ties knit together as in real life . they get more valuable feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it 's currently entirely obvious . , that players are more time in the virtual world as in the real spend .
i agree that first time to , that it makes sense .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we need to start to the real world in a game to turn into .
my inspiration comes from one event , the 2,500 years , actually shared .
there 's this the ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
in front of these fantastic sketch , there 's <unk> .
and that were , so to the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the mechanics of making an ancient greek <unk> <unk> are familiar , you are so maybe this story . the story about , like , and why games have invented by virtue .
according <unk> were playing games , specifically <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> during a famine , invented .
supposedly , there 's one such great famine , that the king of <unk> , hard to a crazy idea i decided that .
the people who suffered . the people fought .
it was an extreme situation . you needed an extreme solution .
so they invented , according <unk> , that <unk> and agreed to a national strategy . ( in a day would you eat . the next day , you 'd play .
and they would be so much in the <unk> would one being , there play , so fascinating these are and us with <unk> , <unk> productivity by water , that you remember that would be that 's nothing to eat , there .
and then , the next day , you 'd play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> allowing them so 18 years for about this famine , by we use , a day , eating and the next was playing .
it said , i think , put today we 'll play a .
we put play a space to the the suffering from the real world to get away .
we put play a space to all due to think , and , that in the real world 's not work , all , that in real life does n't satisfaction is , and we want to bring us what we need of the play .
but this must not been the current .
this is the compelling .
according <unk> was , wait 18 years , the famine , not better . so i decided to the king , a final <unk> <unk> .
they divided the kingdom , in two halves .
they played a <unk> and the winner allowed to go to a distilled adventure and break it .
they left the <unk> and they would naturally , on the quest for a new home . they left just so many people back , how it food supply to survive there and looking out with the rest , sort of an area , in the them flourish , were .
this sounds crazy , ?
but the latest <unk> showing that the <unk> , the later that <unk> rich , made up , the same dna as the old <unk> <unk> .
so i have come and scientists recently to an attitude , that <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and we geologists found evidence is a global cooling , the almost 20 years took , what the famine explain it could .
so i could take these crazy story to vote .
you might have actually their people through play rescued , by do these 18 years long , in games , escaped have and then this , as far we had , and so much about this one another play learned when you to frame of the whole civilization have saved .
so , that we can also .
we play since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in real the world cup of surgery <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were at 18 years long <unk> , we 're playing house for 16 years of warcraft .
so what i , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent the half of your civilization , on the quest for a new world . therefore i suppose i mean , 21 billion <unk> per week .

i know , they 're going to ask : `` how to solve , we problems of the real world in games ? '' and exactly this question , i mean work in recent years at the center for the future is devoted .
we have this banner , in our office in palo alto , it down on of how we the future can see why should .
we do n't want to try to the future , before to say .
what we want , is the future to create .
we want us that in the best results , imagine . and then people get here pulling , this idea in the reality to prototype .
we imagine epic wins ago , and give people the ways that you to achieve .
i 'll show you very quickly . three games that i designed , to have to pick up to try to people in epic wins in their own future to give yourself .
that this is `` the world without oil . ''
this game is of 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , in the side you a <unk> to get to have to .

we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and tested . and we have you ever since over the last three years , accompanied shops .
and i can tell you , it was a the changing the experience .
nobody wants to life change , because it 's good for the environment is , or because we do it should .
but if you in a distilled adventures are and said , you get , `` of us all about the oil industry . ''
this is a fascinating about adventure , on that you about .
they find out , how they were going to . the most of our greatest players have the the game <unk> habits , we could .

we have the game , `` <unk> '' at the center for the future has evolved .
starting point is the calculation of a <unk> , that the people are only still am 23 years on the planet left have .
this massive supercomputer called `` global . <unk> <unk> '' , of course .
the call to players , naturally , to sign , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> designed .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it that `` <unk> '' there . you have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> and just put together , they can save the world .
but in our game , instead of the only five people , we say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of the social justice to create .
8,000 players who played the game , eight weeks before long .
they found the 500 incredibly creative solutions that they do you read can , if you , `` <unk> '' google it .
and the last game we bring down at 3 . march out . it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank .
if you the game , close to get them from the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> , '' the end by 2010 .
we 're working with the universities in all of sub-saharan africa and they invite a , social <unk> to learn .
we have a comic book on this . we have `` level up '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and his ingenuity .
i want you all invite , this game with young people to share , all around the world , mostly in <unk> , the sake of benefits , naturally , and develop their own social enterprises imagine , across the world to save .
i come well , to end .
i want you something interesting questions .
what , you think , what happens when the next ?
we have all these fantastic players , we have games that us to know what we can do , but we have to the real world still not be saved .
well i , i hope you to me that it can agree that players are human resources are , that we managed to work in real life skills in can , and games to a big meaning for change the business .
we have are all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability to very tight , social nets to knit , <unk> and that urge , sort <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we keep them together a significant play games to knock on this planet have a few examples of the 20th century to survive .
and i hope that they 're going to work with me that of play a design and play .
if i go on the next decade <unk> , i 'm extremely efficient in two things i 'm sure : that we each <unk> the pipeline creating can , and that we all kinds of play games can .
so i say , let the <unk> games to start !
thanks .
i would you 'd like a little bit about what to me ago , a few months of the can write of an article for <unk> wired noticed is .
i have the can write always my <unk> our questions , but i was with the frontier of making <unk> already done , and i 've noticed on , that i still never in my life <unk> of have , what the word `` the disabled , '' really means .
i read them the post ago .

<unk> : healthy , strong , exquisitely sensitive . ''
i have this list of a friend , according to read to and i had 'll find laughter , it that worked so ridiculous , but i came just to go , `` <unk> '' and i could n't even more <unk> , and had to stop to read and me first place to collect after this <unk> <unk> and the the order to <unk> emotional shock .
of course was that a <unk> , old <unk> . i 've told me just thought , that the copy already quite old be present .
but actually it was a copy on the early 1980s , when i just with the elementary started and so , we started , my self from outside of my in the family , along with build and to forms , also in terms on other children and to the rest of the world , to look around me .
and god is right now , thanks , i then , no <unk> used .
i would this post take seriously i would have in a world was born , that someone like me as a person who are able to fall , whose lives in <unk> way , positive , it makes you can . today , but i 'm going for the opportunity and adventure , that i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i just made it down at the <unk> of 2009 navigated and expecting that i do here a <unk> contribution to find .
there 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
happen to be is they 're not much better .
especially <unk> me the last two words , perhaps , `` near , <unk> '' `` very , '' and `` healthy . ''
but it ca n't just with the words .
it 's about , what we think about the people think , that we do with these words to describe .
it goes to take the values , the in these words stuck , and how we these values build it .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and the people to carry around us see .
many <unk> societies , including the the greek and the roman , have really believed that one of the way it 's one of <unk> a great force has , because that , what you , according <unk> , , too <unk> can .
so , what we want to actually <unk> -- a are those people or a , powerful people ?
alone , already a people <unk> as a child to call myself , could be enough , you the emissions and you an idea of the <unk> .
it would n't beautiful , you doors to open up ?
a person , the for me the doors has opened , was my pediatrician , at the <unk> . dupont , the institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he 's called `` dr. <unk> . a <unk> , on in my name , like , you want to think we can , the most americans are not accurate would just could . so , he was always , dr. p. called .
and dr. p. wore it always very colorful , flying and was for the work with kids , just like created .
i found the time , i went in this hospital , i spent some of have , just great -- until on my <unk> .

and ask , you want ago , . i 've actually been known as <unk> kid with dr. p. negotiate and so here 's trying to these exercise to stop , <unk> with no success .

and if you get it and she says , i give you from a hundred dollars . ''
that was obviously just a simple and trick of dr. p. , so that i the exercises that i do that do n't i wanted to do , with the prospect , that the richest five-year-old girl in the ward in the second stick to be . but he has made me in fact that we were brought to my daily <unk> with new eyes . they are like this was that they have a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now , how much as his vision of me as strong and powerful tool young girl , my self being formed has and i told me so imagine being able to me as a kind of , strong , , powerful and <unk> person to see .
this is just a sample of many , as adults in <unk> the imagination of a child work force can .
but how the already been quoted examples of the <unk> prove that , we get to our language , no room , naturally , something to imagine , from what we all want one would : it every single to give the themselves , as , powerful people to see .
our language is behind the societal change , afterwards , the in many cases , through a technological change that triggered by virtue .
from medical standpoint of you look at you can kind of course , say , that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titan , and becomes <unk> of materials ranging from body , that it allow people , really all their opportunities to use , little bit about the borders , that you your natural , which he 'd actually has , beyond to develop , not begin to speak of its social <unk> platforms , people to do was a standard , own identity , giving , now , there own way , and the way it is that , and wondering , so that the world , next to groups are choosing a , where , choose .
maybe that 's ever so this technological change and clear , because i ever seen that 's always been one other inconvenient truth gave , which is , that every man of society , something very <unk> and very powerful tool can give and that the human ability , to start to adapt , our biggest plus is .

this phrase from the -- with the odds that lives of the idea that success or happiness of it depends on , a challenge to <unk> , without any of the with being applied on experience this shape to be . as if my life so successful , it makes it would , because i the kinds of falling of a life with a prosthetic limb of the way could , or how do anything that people to me with my disability to perceive .
but the truth is , that we will change . course , we 're talking about the challenge this shape , no matter whether you physically , emotional , or even the two is
and i would argue that the number is good .
odds are not an obstacle , that we <unk> to begin to stand with our lives better clear to come .
odds are real easy to our lives .
and i tend to tell us , gave , as my shadow , to see .
sometimes i realize that he 's very your mind is , sometimes is he 's hard to see , but he 's the time with me .
and i want to make it is not at the effect '' or . the heavy years of the <unk> one of people , degrading .
there 's in everybody gave , and challenges , and that are just <unk> real and each person is going to hit different from my head . but the question is not , whether we do with the odds be clear to know , or not , but how we ought to realize that come .
so we 're not just responsible for , the people who we love , ago <unk> to maintain , but they also goes to prepare , well , so clear to come .
and we out to be our kids do n't have fallen , if we do you feel like this give you to , it’s not to shift can .
you have to two things i realized that 'll : one thing , the medical fact , an amputee , to be and to the other the social landscape that i think about , if i disabled , i 'm or not .
and if to be honest , to be , the only real and persistent disabled , with the time i was really just sit had , this is that the world , the time , says , they could do to me with these definition , describe .
in our desire , the people to protect , the us at the heart , who are and you the you out , hard to the truth about their medical prediction informs , or even a prediction that to the quality to imagine that they do n't expect , we need to pay attention , that we 're not the really made for being put that somebody actually a matter is .
maybe this is value in the concept , the only to appear to pay attention , what 's in a broken , is , and how we the repair , for every single one of greater disability than the pathology there is , .
if we have a people not worth distinguishing treat , and not all its forces and opportunity to perceive and to acknowledge , we do , we in addition to the the natural struggle , the you may lead to the fact , one another disease .
we <unk> a people , the for our society , a value by .
so we need to about the <unk> look out and us on all the part of the human possibilities to focus .
at the most importantly , but this is that 's between the perception of our pushing and our great the human ingenuity , a connection there .
we should those challenging times , not <unk> or in denial , we should have neither work to them to avoid , still we should you among the carpet return , but it 's about , in the odds of opportunity to see it .
it 's about me that might be more about the fact , clear to ask , that we gave , not necessarily need to get to the fact , but that we do that is open , are , they flocked to hug , and make it seize to stick to recognize also time a <unk> to use and maybe even with it to dance .
and maybe do we make it , gave , as a little natural , coherent and useful to see , and we do with us that way through their presence not more than that had a huge .
the year in a celebration , we the 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution has written , has to darwin , in my eyes , on something very true self in the human nature of pointed out .
i would it so <unk> : not the most powerful truck of you survive , and also not the <unk> his way , but the , the road , changes the right place to shift can .
of conflict that amount of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the skill levels of people , to survive and <unk> , from the struggle '' of human spirit can be done is , naturally , by conflict to turn this .
so , so again , change and things , we are the greatest skills of making people .
and maybe we know , first , from which -- wood and we ball of these are , if we really went through a whole .
maybe this is that 's exactly the sense of the odds , a perception of making these eyes , a feeling for our own power .
we can go so even something like to give them .
we can be adversities , a new meaning to give a , over really tough times beyond what about .
maybe we can we gave , as a change you see .
odds to stand for a change , off the time we still do n't have adapted .
i think , on the back to harm , the time we even in danger point have , is to believe that we normally be supposed to .
time to be honest -- who is normal ?
there 's not a normal .
there 's the usual . the typical . but not the normal . and they would those poor , the gray person 's really get to know that we want , if it they really convinced that ?
i think , rather , not .
it would be great , if we have this shift the piles up against a different the opportunity or the strength to knock it even still a little bit dangerous to proposing to accomplish this could . so we can the forces of very many kids to release and they use to invite , their very particular , and being in the skills in the society are today .
<unk> 've got out found out that we humans from the members of our society and bigger one who claimed that have : useful to be and a contribution to afford .
there 's cues on it , that already the neanderthals ago , 60,000 years older people and people with severe , physical injuries , with an idea leader who have and this was in perhaps , because the life experience in <unk> of these people for the society , valuable was :
they have these people not as a broken and useless 's down ; they were as something special , and valuable , treated .
i 'm in a few years i went in the city , in the i grew up was , in a <unk> in 's when the `` the red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there have a huge <unk> everything from .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> matters .
and i am , as a guy behind me say , `` well , if that 's not <unk> <unk> is . ''
and i turn , me to try and i see these elders man . i had no idea who he 's .
and i was like `` sorry , sir , we 've known for us ? and i ca n't come out , you remember . ''
and he said , `` well , yeah , you one you , i knew hardly back to me remind .
when i did she was the first time i saw , i figured out , you out of the belly of her mother was getting . ''
oh , so the .
and of course , there 's but then they click , done .
that was , dr. <unk> , a man , the i just from multiple narratives of my mother about this day i knew , because i course , very typical , to my birthday , two weeks to be late came .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was in the vacation , and so , we knew my parents the man , the me to the world 's got to do n't actually .
and because i do without <unk> was born , and my feet of water , after them pointing had and i just a few toes , does this and a few toes , at the other foot do was he the <unk> , this stranger who had the bad news your book .
he said to me , `` i had to build your parents say , that you never walk , would , and it 's never <unk> be , would like the other children or that you never a completely independent life lead if you could , and since they have to me simply lying <unk> . ''
really extraordinary , i found that he 's <unk> my entire childhood , collected and eventually , whatever , if i held in <unk> in the second grade , won had , if i do with the <unk> done in the mermaid parade , to <unk> our way was , whatever , if i do for a fellowship , or a friend of <unk> wins <unk> had , and he was using these clips to pick up his students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .

you can just not enough to point , how critical supplies of a factor for the quality of a people can be .
and dr. <unk> told further , he said , `` i learned that children , if you do n't always on something else said , you get , and also if you just a little support to get to having children , and of <unk> , then you can children , very much to achieve . ''
you see , dr. <unk> has to be thinking has changed .
he had understood , that the medical diagnosis , and as anyone with it can handle , two different things are .
and also i quit my thinking over the course the time has changed , if you me the age of 15 years to ask you have said , if i mean to those who against the legs of meat and bone <unk> have said , then i would have no one second <unk> .
i wanted to go back then i would have normal work today .
if you me that today to ask , i 'm extremely not so sure .
and that 's happening , because i do something with my legs , experienced , to have and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this change is also happen , because i so many people in a while i 'm going to the me through the door opened have , instead of people to encounter , made me to cut , or me an idea of the system on wanted .
you see , it takes a really just a people , the you demos , as you their powers . <unk> can , and they 're going through .
if you it 's someone to occur , his own , inside of forces to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you that create , and for anyone in a critical moment a door to open , then they 're looking for these people a very good teachers .
they bring them in the name themselves , the doors to open .
the really the importance of nuclear power of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means , something to bring on , that in a is , the potential <unk> .
so again : which the potential to do we want , then , can access ?
in the '60s years was in britain 's a <unk> done . at that were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` <unk> <unk> '' in the united states , what we call this as `` <unk> . ''
the students to be after the notes up into .
and the `` a student will <unk> harder to have to pass , get the better teacher , so forth .
they have then over a <unk> period of students with a `` well enough , '' the top grade , `` very well , '' gave them . it was you said , they were the <unk> you to very clever would be . and after these three months have you really <unk> written .
and of course <unk> 's a the heart to hear that way around the <unk> been said , they were the only have enough .
and much it was then after the three months , too .
but only one of us who are still in the school were -- apart from the students , the the school , throwing had .
very crucial thing in this trial was , that the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teachers who did n't know that something changed the house .

the only really at disability is a completely broken mind is a spirit , the broken was , has no hope that anymore . he find nothing more beautiful . it , the lack of our natural , into one of curiosity . and our innate capacity to the <unk> .
if we do it , but creating , the human spirit and offers to support to continue to hope for themselves , and other people to age range , around . if you find , and passion <unk> to be then put we our foreign forces that really positive or a .
if a mind about those qualities have access , we can be a new reality and new <unk> create .
i want with a poem by saying , this one of a persian poet named <unk> in 14 century . '' written by thinking and any of the me my friend , jacques <unk> told by . and the poem called `` the god , the only four words that 's better . '' `` every child knows , god , not the god the name , not the god of being banned , but the god , the only four words that 's better and these are always being repeated , he says , always just : come to dance with me . ''
come to dance with me . thank you .
