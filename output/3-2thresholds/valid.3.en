you know , one of the big <unk> the can travel and one of the <unk> it at the <unk> research is , together with the people to live , the road , still hold of the old days you can remember . the your past , still living in the wind will feel , you on from the rain <unk> rocks and touch , you in the bitter leaves the plants and taste .
just that know that <unk> still living beyond the milky way to travel , or the importance of myth the oldest the <unk> still a full of meaning that are , or that in the himalayas , the buddhists are still the breath away from the <unk> tracking , which means , naturally , the central epiphany of the anthropology . and the memory to shout out , that 's the idea , that the world , in the we live , not in a total sense that exists , but just as a model of reality , as a consequence of a group of certain ways of the things , we the product we know you , <unk> succeed , ago , many generations of chose .
and of course , sharing , we all those same <unk> .
we all be born . we bring the kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .

but it 's interesting is the unique vocal cadence of making <unk> , the rhythm of the children dance in every culture .
it is the plays it does n't matter , whether it happen to take the <unk> in the woods of borneo is is , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior down in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> middle of in the sahara . this is what happens to the colleague , based on i a month ago in the desert , across 'm . or even a <unk> the side of hanging out over the <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us , that 's still the other <unk> , different kind of thinking , other ways to an orientation on the earth there .
and that 's an idea , the , if you think about which , with just hope to meet you can .
together to form the thousands and cultures , the world a net of <unk> and cultural hero life , that the earth <unk> and for that probably the earth as important is how that biological <unk> , that you as a biosphere that 's better .
you can be wondering , this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can have , and as the sum of all the thoughts and dreams , myths and ideas , inspirations -- and this intuition , the of the human imagination ever since the beginnings of nuclear power of consciousness , being were to be defined .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
they did this symbol of all of the fact , what we 're and seeing what we as an amazing <unk> species can do .
and just like the biosphere , strong , their wake up by , was done this with the <unk> -- only with it , a greater capacity of .
not a biologist would for instance , dare to argue , that 50 percent or more of all species to doing the brink of extinction are , there 's just not true . and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> on the area of biodiversity -- the bubble is hardly at the fact , which gives us as <unk> <unk> on the area of cultural diversity , known is .
and the critical , there may be for that is extinct , the languages .
than any of them in this room was born , were on the earth 6,000 different languages spoken .
now is a language not just the <unk> years of the vocabulary or a series of <unk> .
a language is an expression of human spirit .
you is a means , with the the soul of a given the culture access to the material world finds oneself .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , a turning point , a thought , a single ecosystem of spiritual and opportunities .
and of those emotions and talked to speak today , as we 're here in monterey sit , exactly the half not more in the ears of children <unk> .
they are what infants do n't even more taught . that is , if nothing has been doing is , they are actually already been dead .
what could be lonely , creating a distance from silence <unk> to be , one of the last yours is people to be a , your language to talk , no opportunity to have the wisdom of the ancestors feel the , or the hope for children to expect ?
and yet , stamp this horrible , which he actually , somebody somewhere on the earth , i think about . all over two weeks , because of all the two weeks , you kill a lot of older , man and take the last <unk> of an old language with hormones , into the grave .
and i know that some of you say , `` it 's not better than that ? '' would be the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to talk to count ? '' and i say : '' well , `` let this language , yoruba be . , let them <unk> be .
`` let them kogi be . ''
and then they would suddenly realize , how it would , if you their own language not could talk .
why i want you today a way , on a trip across the <unk> take away , a quick trip across the <unk> , in order to try to you get across to do , which actually been lost is .
now there 's some under us , the kind of the forget that i do , when i say `` different ways way of being , '' really different ways way of being mean .
take them for instance , this child the <unk> in the northwest , the amazon , the nation of the <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from east , from , in the belly of sacred , snakes <unk> .
this is a , the people , which is not in cognitively between the colors , blue and green is different , because that <unk> the the forest , of the top of the people depend , <unk> is .
they have a appear to language and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> is called , you 've got to anyone get married , the one another language , talks .
all this is rooted in the mythological past . that appear to hold of these big houses , in which are because the <unk> six or seven languages spoken to be , is , is , that you never hear somebody who hear , the one language is learning .
you hear the only to and start then to talk .
or , one of the <unk> tribes , with which i ever lived , to have to the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , a an amazing , the people , the first realized then , in 1958 peaceful and i contacted by thinking .

they threw a new form of photos of incarceration , of the air , top-down , what we as kind , gesture rate that would . have , and saturated you that these people out of the rainforest in your life is still never be something <unk> had seen .

but the <unk> killed , not only people be with the spear .
they <unk> to start to each other .
54 percent of the deaths were happening through <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations go back and found two million cases of a natural death , and when we the people with <unk> something about <unk> , gave them to realize that one of the people that old become was that he 's partly because of his own lives when she died , and we 're killing him and yet with the spear .
but at they had a clear ignoring the head of the forest , the one has been .
their business of being able to the urine of an animal from 40 up of distance smell and determine , to of plant species , this was on .
in the early <unk> years , i got a really amazing job , as me my professor in the harvard , he said , if i took it be interested , after i was quickly to go and the secret societies have to infiltrate the ones that foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> were and the venom , that for it was used to pick <unk> to do , sure .
so to this sensation having a sense , to do i had to course , something about these remarkable believe in the space <unk> know , and <unk> is that they not a cult of the black magic .
in the opposite , it 's essentially , hard to find a complex , forget about at the world .
it 's interesting .
if i they were to ask , the great world faiths , or to , what they would say ?
christianity , islam , in buddhism , <unk> or what do anything that .
a continent will always leave out , because the things will was that it comes in sub-saharan africa ca n't be religious belief in give them . course there 's a and <unk> 's just that , that is this very <unk> religious thought , the during the tragic diaspora to the <unk> <unk> .
but what <unk> so interesting is doing , is these are living relationship between the living and the dead .
the living give birth the spirit .
the spirit can go from underneath the big water of evoking be , the answers on the rhythm of the children dance , which to the soul of making living with whom to <unk> , so that the <unk> for her a shiny moment to the god will .
<unk> say the <unk> like , `` your white goes in the church , and you talk about god .
we dancing in the temples , and be able to god . ''
and because you been obsessed , me , you 'll get any of the spirit <unk> . how can see you damage the third danger to be ?

now , of all people , that i met , to have , were the kogi from the sierra nevada and de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most extreme .
the next of the old <unk> civilization , the the <unk> plain from colombia world , the and in a consequence of the conquest , i moved to acquire this , the people in a <unk> volcanic in no way back , that about the <unk> plain <unk> .
in a <unk> continent , were these people are the only that do n't move from the <unk> conquered were .
the way to today , the day , they become of a ritual priesthood govern ourselves . the training to the priesthood is , is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> be the age of three and four years of their families are separated and in a <unk> world , the dark , and , in <unk> at the <unk> the glacier , for 18 years by that . two periods of each , nine years , deliberately who wants to pick the nine months of the pregnant emulate , that they in which resulted in their <unk> mother to contribute to spend them now <unk> in which resulted in the big mother .
and during this whole time , they become a cultural in the value in their society in place . values , the the claim sustain that sharing their prayer and only their prayer , the cosmic -- or we can say that environmental issues -- that balance sustain .
the end of these amazing <unk> you will be one day , suddenly , looking out there 's taken and to the first time in your life , the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise that . and in this <unk> moment of consciousness of what the first light spectrum , if the sun 's starting on the <unk> the remarkably good stuff that landscape to rays , is becoming suddenly everything , what they in abstract 've learned in an amazing glory and confirmed . and the priest kick the past and says , `` you see ? it 's really , as i 'm so telling you have more .
it 's so wonderful . you ought it to protect them . ''
they call to start to the older , brothers and say , that we , that we the younger , brothers are , for the destruction of the world are responsible .
now this level of the intuition is very important .
always if we 're going to any indigenous and the landscape , think , conjure we 're either <unk> and the old <unk> years of the fancy wild up afterwards , which in his simplification a <unk> and the idea is , or other hand thoreau and say , these people are more with the nature is connected , when we .
so , which indigenous groups are neither sentimental , still be they line of nostalgia ill .
it stays not much space for it in the <unk> swamps , of <unk> or the cold winding of tibet , they have , though yet , through time and the ritual a mysterious <unk> the earth is shaped , the not on the idea is based , her town of close to be , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth is , if only exist can , because they 're in the human consciousness <unk> will .
now , which means that ?
it says that a little girl from the andes , that in the way i think we can grow up , that the mountain in a <unk> is , the hardware , or her destiny to determine , is a very other person will , and a different relationship to this resource , or this place have , as a little girl from montana , that in the way i think we can grow up , that a mountain in a bunch of stone is that 's in their wake can be .
if he had a <unk> one of mind or a bunch <unk> is , is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor , which the relationship between the the individual and the nature is defined .
i grew up in the woods of , british colombia , on and i believed that these forests that says there are , <unk> use .
that made me to take a different people as my friends , under the <unk> , the believe that these forests of the <unk> of <unk> and the the curved <unk> and the <unk> spirits are , the parts of <unk> the world who live , the spirits out that they do at their <unk> involve you would .
now , if you start to the idea to look at that these cultures are different realities are able to respond , but you see some of their extraordinary discoveries to understand . like there . this plant here .
it 's a picture , that i 've just last april , in the northwest , the amazon had taken .
this is <unk> , of the whole lot of you 've heard , the most powerful sorts preparation , from the repertoire of what the shaman again .

these plant , contains some very strong <unk> the short of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very much like this is .
it , if you already , even the <unk> have seen , as you this stuff <unk> , this substance that they do from different ways that we make it contains that also <unk> .
this <unk> to <unk> that 's about how from a <unk> <unk> to be , <unk> of <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it is no distortion of reality is creating , but the resolution of reality .

but the thing with <unk> is that you to do n't <unk> <unk> can be , because you through a in the human gut , of course <unk> enzyme , with names <unk> , <unk> be .
you can only in touch with some other chemicals <unk> <unk> be a , the mao <unk> .
now that 's fascinating , that the <unk> , the in the <unk> in them are , <unk> of exactly the way that are , that is necessary to pick the <unk> to <unk> . questions , you want so itself .
how can these people from a <unk> of 80,000 species <unk> plant these two , morphologically and not related to plant find the ones , if on this way , combined , a kind of <unk> version of creating , so that the whole greater than the sum of its parts is ?
we use these great euphemism , trial and error , what the road , as being meaningless turns out .
but we ask you the native americans tell you , `` the plant , talks to us . ''
so , which means that ?
this tribe , the <unk> , i 've got 17 different forms of the best <unk> that they do all share with one great distance in the forest realize that fit for our eyes of as appear .
and then ask you put them , as you your <unk> see it , and they say , `` i thought , you understand , something of plants .
i mean , do you know anything at all ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns , totally out that you any of the 17 different varieties -- in the <unk> <unk> and they sing to a in a different <unk> .
so , that brings them , not a ph.d. in the harvard , but it 's more interesting than <unk> to count .
so , that <unk> the problem is that , even the ones , given us , the concerns for the difficult to be able to the native americans have to them as <unk> and colorful , look , you , however , kind on the past <unk> , during the real world , which way our world , progresses .

all cultures have been wondering , and tried to any given the dance with new <unk> involved .
and the problem is not the technology is , if you .
the <unk> and they had not less on the sioux to be , when you must bow and the arrow of tasks , as the americans who stopped americans to be , when you a horse and <unk> tasks .
ca n't change , and technology could threaten the integrity of the <unk> . it 's power . that ugly face the turn out .
and where anything that you 're wondering , in the world <unk> , you will discover that these cultures , not for the <unk> <unk> are . this are extremely dynamic , living peoples , whose existence through <unk> forces , so much , is the about their capacity of the things , we go beyond . whether it happen , man , around the <unk> logging in the country of the <unk> is is , a <unk> from asia , of <unk> , a , the people , the front of a generation freely in the the forest , living , and now to <unk> and prostitution , at the river mortified that was , from where you can see , that even the river with the mud , polluted going to the nearly half borneo , in the <unk> sea <unk> seems . of where the japanese <unk> at the horizon , to see are , that are willing to their <unk> with the raw <unk> to fill that they do the the forest away from our security . or as in the case the <unk> , where it <unk> are a , during the <unk> <unk> were .

you know , the genocide , that <unk> extinction of people will not secret convicted , but the <unk> , the destruction of lifestyle and the people , will not just not be convicted , but generally , and <unk> as part of a <unk> celebrated .
and you can the suffering <unk> n't understand , if you do n't it on <unk> level have lived .
and i went even with a young colleagues got 6,000 of miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> by <unk> after <unk> and only when i call to <unk> came , i saw the face , behind the statistics of which you hear . 6,000 holy monuments , the in the rubble , and anybody who turned into were . 1.2 million people , the during the cultural revolution of the <unk> was killed were .

this meant that he 's during the chinese invasion immediately get killed the house .
be an uncle bug living with their sanctity in the diaspora , the people that for nepal , got .
his mother was locked up , as much punishment , for -- for the crime wealthy to be .
he was the age of two years in the prison smuggled which to form , under your <unk> to hide , because they do without it not life could .
the twin sister , that these <unk> did <unk> , was in a <unk> to the country .
one day i stepped them out of prices on on a tags <unk> and for these <unk> had them for seven years in a heavy , labor .
the suffering <unk> can become intolerable be , but the <unk> mind the people 's something <unk> .
and the end , where we 're really ago , a choice . do we want in a <unk> world , the <unk> or in a <unk> world , the diversity of life ?
margaret mead , now , the anthropologist who said before they died , that 's their greatest fear is that , while we 're in towards a thread , <unk> , generic at the world move , we 're not just the whole range of the human imagination , on a <unk> the way of reduces would see , but that we one day from a dream , wake up , and i 've forgotten , that it ever other ways , there .
and it 's really humbling . that to think , that our species in may have been over 600,000 years longer exists .
the <unk> revolution , the us that agriculture , got , and us this moment in the the cult of making <unk> <unk> , the poetry to develop the shaman looked through the prose the priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization and the surplus , created -- i found in front of them just 10,000 years , instead .
the modern industrial world as we know them is n't wait for 300 years old .
now , this <unk> history tells me not saying that we all the answers on the challenges have , which we in the next several millennia of us to stand .
if we those thousands and <unk> after the importance of you are being human questions , the answers you with 10,000 various voices .
and in this song , we become the opportunity to rediscover that didn’t have to be , what we are : people with under way that consciousness , the fact , the importance of , are , that all people and gardens , a room -- an the way to <unk> to cure . and there 's great moments of what the optimism .
here 's a picture , that i was in the northern hemisphere is the end <unk> had taken , when i do with <unk> on the <unk> went . and this man , <unk> , i told me a wonderful story of his <unk> .
the canadian government is not always very well with the <unk> the others and during the <unk> years in the process of the establishment of our turn out , , they were forced , in those settlements , to draw .
the grandfather of this old man 's refused to go .
the family , the fear of them to be life had , took him all of guns and all the tools to leave .
now have to you know that the <unk> not afraid of one of the cold have . they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> their <unk> were originally from fish , the in <unk> wrapped up was , made .
the grandfather passed away from the man , feared , it’s not in front of the arctic night , or the the <unk> storm .
he <unk> after the outside , she made his pants off , <unk> that down and <unk> in his hand . and as the feces to seize that started , shaped , he goes , the form of a <unk> .
he <unk> saliva , on the sides of making <unk> and when it completely frozen was , <unk> he 's a dog with it .

so you can kind of nothing to do something .
and this is on tour of mine in a symbol of the resistance of the <unk> and all of the native lands on the world .
the canadian government , there was the <unk> in april 1999 , the complete control over a field back , the greater is as in california , and in texas , together .
it 's our new home country , and i mean <unk> .
it 's a completely independent area . they control all <unk> .
a which is an example , as a nation , the state , the atonement with its people live for , and can achieve .
and ultimately , i believe , it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us , the to these distant aim the earth , across are , to see , that they do n't actually take away from .
they are the <unk> of someone .
they represent the parts of the human imagination , the in ... what did at the way back . and for all of us to be the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our own children and part of geography of hope .
what we share with national geographic and finally , trying to do is that we believe that politicians ever get something to achieve .

156 nations to send our tv channel .
our design magazines can be of millions of reading .
and we are taking a series of travel in the <unk> , on that we 're our audience to places of such as cultural and wonder is take you to any of the that you just <unk> be . and hopefully , they become a after the other the central epiphany of the anthropology , suppose : that this world , it deserves and eventually , on different in ways to exist out that we have a <unk> in a really multicultural <unk> world can find , the side of the wisdom of all people to our shared and well-being can contribute .
thank you .
what i do you first , as quickly as possible , you 'll show , is the fundamental work , a new technology , that we microsoft , as part of a <unk> ago exactly a year , given to have . this is <unk> . and it 's an environment , in the either you locally . right away with huge amounts of visual data can deal .
we see many , gigabytes , seen digital photographs here , that you would blend seamlessly , and constantly <unk> , pan , on to any way forward to arrangements that can .
and it 's no matter , how many of information , we look at how large that this huge collections of these are or how big the images are .

it makes no difference , because the one thing , what the performance of the system like this be constrained can , is the number of just a pixel on your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible , architecture .
this is a whole book , a sample of <unk> .
this is <unk> house to of <unk> . every tearing is a chapter .
to prove that it is , it’s really wanting to a text and not to find a picture of satisfaction , we can do something like that do anything to really , showing that that 's an actual representation of making <unk> and not a picture is .
maybe is a world becomes way , a <unk> to read .
i would it does n't recommend .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of [ the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of a <unk> .
and that there you really the pleasure and the good experience a real <unk> a magazine , or a newspaper to read , which is , if a kind of medium with several scales is .
we 've also something that sort of the corner of these special edition of resources , [ the guardian did .
we have a wrong with this is very high <unk> designed , the much higher than with a normal earlier this is , and we have extra content , added .
if you the features of this cars look like , you , they can you see here .
or different models , or even a technical <unk> .
and this time , and really these ideas on , these constraints , for the available to place on the screen arguments that .
we hope that its n't add pop-ups and other nonsense , more mean -- that should not necessary to be .
obviously this is that mapping then one of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i want to here 's really not much to spend time , except to say , that we also to this area contribute to be .
but this are all roads in the united states ; it .
<unk> up on the <unk> picture of the nasa .
let them to us now something more engaging .
this is actually now live in the internet . you can it <unk> .
this is a project with the name <unk> that 's really two different technologies to everything comes together .
the one is <unk> and the other is a very good the research <unk> waves , noah <unk> , a <unk> the university of washington , under the advice from steve <unk> , among the <unk>
and rick <unk> of microsoft research , and did was . a very good working together .
so this is live in the internet . it will of <unk> driven .
you can see that in , if we these kinds of views are able to engage in which we by images through , can and this experience the <unk> <unk> do .
but the spatial still be the pictures is here , indeed of meaning .
the <unk> have these pictures together , lasted so they 're seeing the real space , in the top of these images , the all in near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian rockies , were made , equal . you see here elements of <unk> slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in perspective in the relationship with each other , put it .
i do n't know exactly , if i still time , to have you very different environments to show .
there 's which , the whole lot of spatial are .

we had to us , because of the lawyers and so forth . need to make decisions .
this is a <unk> the cathedral <unk> lady , that exclusively in computers with images from flickr and after every time . give you just <unk> lady in the flickr , that , and they 're going to pictures of men in a t-shirt and on the <unk> so forth . get . each of orange <unk> represents a picture that as to this model <unk> was discovered .
and so they 're doing this all <unk> , and they all stand in perspective on this way in the relationship with each other .
and we can be in this very simple way to navigate .
. you know , i 've never did , that i finally worked at microsoft 's work , let me .
i 'm very grateful for the <unk> here .
. i suspect , you can see that this many different kinds of cameras are : everything is the coolest , of the <unk> to professional <unk> , a pretty large number of them , the all in this environment me up were .
and when possible , i 'm going to some of the weird to find .
many of you 're of faces and by each so forth .
somewhere here are a series of photography -- here are you .
this is actually a poster of <unk> lady , the right recorded was .
we can any of the poster to a physical view this environment and change .
the point is here , that we do things with the social environment of do you can . it will now data from all gathered together -- any of the entire of mass of memory of them , like , visually , the planet looks -- and everything is connected to each other .
all these photographs will be connected to each and it that amount of something that the greater is as the sum of the parts .
they get a model , that from around the earth of structure .
at them that as the sequel of labor of stephen <unk> to any virtual earth .
and that 's something that by the complexity , with the the people using it , growing and of going to search for the user , with the application bigger and will .
their own photos to be with metadata <unk> , the one another person 's just being from .
if , it’s someone the trouble has done and all this holy there are all has and becomes , who you 're all , then is my picture of the <unk> <unk> suddenly , with all this data is held and i can you when you started using to stand in this space to scuba diving , in this <unk> , the photos of the other people use and be a kind of <unk> <unk> social experience with the usage of other of players doing .
and of course , the byproduct of all of who are the immense , rich , virtual models of any interesting part of the earth , the not just by <unk> or a satellite and so on get there were , but through collective of memory .
thank you .
. now i do you right ? their software to not to continue to look at a certain , within the next few years , all images , the of someone in the world together to be used in principle , one another linked to be ?
yes . she does nothing else than to explore .
if you want , made them to hyperlinks , between the images .
and they do , this because of years of the content , in the images .
and that 's really exciting , if we use , the wealth of the semantic information , think , the lot of these images have them .
as if you a <unk> for images make change , where they sentences 'll ask , and the lyrics of the website that contains a lot of information about , which is a picture that is .
but how would it , if this picture of them with all their pictures of the reason ?
then is the scope of the semantic <unk> and the abundance , the road , it basically , really enormous . it 's a classic <unk> .
<unk> , that 's really incredible , congratulations .
you have very much .
i 'll tell you some things from my book , telling the , as i hope that in unison with other things are the they have heard . and i 'm trying to myself a couple of connections to create , it , if you this is n't have noticed this is .
i want with the start , what i `` the official dogma '' i call .
the official dogma of what ?
the official <unk> of any western industrialized world societies .
the official dogma in it 's this : if our target that to maximize the head of the common our own citizens , is , is about this do so , by the <unk> the freedom of making individual .
the reason for this is , the liberty in to itself is good , valuable to make sense , a <unk> principal requirement for the human .
when people freedom to have , then is is any of us for , and of the radiation to do things , the our public good to maximize and nobody has for us to decide .
the way of freedom to maximize is a choice to maximize efficient .

this is , i think , so deeply in our water supply ones are , that it has never put in the sense to come would it to ask questions .
and it 's also deeply in our lives rooted in .
i 'm going to you some examples going to give what makes us modern progress the technologies .
this is my supermarket . not a big .
i just want to doing something about <unk> say .
there 's 175 <unk> in my supermarkets , if you the 10 different order to do <unk> n't <unk> and 12 <unk> that they buy it might be able to find a large number of their own , lettuce <unk> making , in the the <unk> case , no idea that the 175 in that store , for them is true .
so this is , like the grocery store is .
and then they go to the the <unk> business plan to a <unk> up with an -- some speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , <unk> . and in this a surplus electronics business , there 's so many <unk> facilities .
we can <unk> millions of different <unk> facilities put together , from the components , the in this a business , offered to be .
they must admit that that 's a large selection is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
it gave a time , when i 'm a boy was , there , you could every phone , hosts have the you wanted to long as he of ma bell was happening .
they have your phone <unk> . you have n't it <unk>
a consequence of smallpox was , that the telephone is ever broken , was .
these days are over .
we 've now almost an infinite selection , those phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
this are the mobile phones , the future .
my favorite is the in the center -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> torch around .
and they should be that until now , still not in your business have seen , they can be sure that they do it soon be .
and what it does it 's going to help people to tell us in the business to walk and this question to imagine .
you know now what the answers that question is ?
the answer is `` no . ''
it 's not possible a phone to buy , that 's not to be much does .
in other aspects of life in that are very much as far more important than that buy one of <unk> 're going to hit the same kind of explosion of the <unk> to .
health -- it 's not known for the case in the united states that you to the doctor 's go and the doctor says , you what to do is .
instead , get to the doctor and the doctor says , you : why we have a to make or why we have b to do .
a , has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what you want to do ?
and they say , `` doctor , what should i do ? ''
the doctor says , a , has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you i would be , doctor , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not you . ''
the result is -- we call it `` patient , autonomy . '' that sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift the burden of the responsibility for the meeting of making of someone , that you know -- namely the doctor -- to somebody on the patient does n't know , and likely to be sick is , and why not in the best constitution , is a decision to meet -- namely the patient .
there 's a tremendous marketing , for <unk> medicine for people like you and me , that , if you think about , does n't make sense of power , because we do n't you buy .
why do n't advertise they 're beginning to us , if we 're not able to buy ?
the answer is : they sort of us the doctor in the next morning to call up and to find a change of the prescription to ask .
something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide to demonstrate .
we , i 'd not an identity , we invent you .
and we invent us so often to examine how we want .
that is , that every day , if you the morning , wake up , you to decide , which for one of person they could be really want .
in terms on marriage and family , there 's a time , in the the <unk> was , that almost every one had and that you so fast were married , as you could , and then as fast as children got as you could .
the only true that election was `` who '' to do n't know when , and not what they do , we did .
nowadays everything is just have them .
i 'm teaching been an intelligent , students , and i 'll give you 20 percent less work as i used did .
and that 's not because , it’s pretty smart are , and not because they have less carefully , are .
it 's because you with other things too , are going to ask them to itself , `` should i married , or not ? should i now to marry ?
should i later , marry ? should i only have kids , or not only have never been doing ? ''
that are all <unk> questions .
and they 're going to answer those questions regardless of if that means that all the tasks to do that i do you <unk> and no good note in my class to get one .
and , indeed they should be here . and this are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we 're blessed , as carl that 's ever has , with the technology is the us to take place every minute of every day from any place on the planet to work -- until on the <unk> hotel .
there 's the way , a corner , of the i do n't leave me tell 'm going to with the that <unk> works .
i 'm it does n't tell you , because i use it , you want .
so what it means , this extraordinary freedom of choice we have in terms on of making decisions to meet , and again , and again , whether we have to work or not have to work .
we can our children , during the football games to move beyond , and we have our mobile phones , the a hip , and our blackberry , among other hip , and our laptop probably going on our lap .
and also if you all off , are , every minute , in the we our child , during the <unk> of a soccer <unk> we ask it 's , `` i should this call assume ?
i should be in this email answers ? should i 've got this letter writing ? ''
and also if the answer to the question `` no , '' is it 's made sure your experience means that the <unk> their children 's <unk> very different than it would have been .
everywhere , where we look closely , great things and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world in the we lived looked like this .
so that i want , i say , it had a couple of choices , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world in the now we live looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is `` yes . ''
we all know what good at it is , so i 'm about what 's bad at it 's .
all these <unk> have two effects , two or negative effects on people .
a effect , <unk> way , is that he 's watch this instead to be free .
with so many options out of the you choose can , it off people very hard to start to do need to decide .
i 'm going to you a another <unk> example going to give a study about investing in volunteers <unk> .
a colleague of me had access on <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million employees and i think about . 2000 , very different jobs .
and what they found was per 10 <unk> the the employer , offered it , took the part in order to two percent decline .
they provide the 50 <unk> of lawsuits -- 10 percent less employees are taking part of as if you just five offer was going . why ?
because it 50 <unk> are , the one about choosing to stand , it 's so hard to decide which then you choose to which you to do it on the morning , the boxes .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's coming out of course never .
you know about saying that 's not just mean , that people <unk> to eat , if they come in retirement go , because they 're not enough money , to put them on have , it also means , that make decisions that hard thing is that they big <unk> your employers to miss .
by the not participating in give them up to 5,000 u.s. dollars is a year on any of the employer , the happy would have been their contributions to reproduce .
of paralysis , is a consequence of to many options .
and i think it makes everything to mess , the world looks like this .
they want to the decision really right to meet , if it for all eternity is , right ?
they do n't want to the wrong investment fund to vote , or even the wrong <unk> .
so this is the an effect . the different effect is that , even if we the tale of over , and make a decision , by saying we have less happy , with the result of the selection , as , if we the opportunity had access to have told us between the less ways to decide .
and there 's several reasons for this .
one of them is upon by the large selection and diverse <unk> , if you one of buy , and it 's not perfect -- and , which <unk> is already been perfect ? it 's easy . they can imagine you to a different decision to have a can meet the better would have been . and what happens is this rough <unk> alternative that leads to then you to the choice we regret , and this regret . so it negative , on the average happiness that they do some of their impacts are that had , as well , if it 's a good choice that was .

secondly , what economists <unk> call .
dan , gilbert , has a big point now this morning , made by he told as a very , the way in the we do things are creating , of it depends on to what we do it 's conceivable .
well , if it very many of alternatives to consider that there , it 's just naturally , attractive properties to picture of alternatives , that they exclude , that makes them less happy , with the alternatives , that they voted on this .
here 's an example . for the of them , the no new york are , apologize i told me .
but here is , what they had n't think should .
here 's a few on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous beach . really wonderful day . you have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? `` damn ! '' the man who thinks , `` it 's an august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood , is the way .
i could directly in front of my house park . ''
and he spend some two weeks of the thought to follow that he the opportunity to miss it has , day about the day , a great joke parking lot to have .
<unk> reduce the average happiness , that we by our choice and get , as well , if that what we chose to have been fantastic case .

here 's a another example .
now , this cartoon is doing some statements .
he makes a statement about in now to live and may also about things too slow to do .
but a very important point , the he does is : always . who do these for one thing to decide to decide , you want to other things not to do .
and these other things like a lot of having an attractive properties have , and it will , what they do to be less appealing to do .
three : <unk> the expectation .
this has no way i met , when i my jeans exchange wanted .
i 'm wearing jeans , almost all the time .
and there 's been a time in the it just jeans a way , there , and they have you bought , and they have a bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and you can think long enough by ice and often enough to be bathed in had , you have started laughing , `` ok . '' <unk> .
so i went to find new jeans to buy after many years of making <unk> the old , and i said , `` i 'd like a few jeans , here 's my size . ''
and the sales and said , `` you want to greater risk , easy <unk> or of the place ?
you want to buttons , or <unk> ? rock or the acid bathed in ?
you want to jeans with holes ?
want them down by far cut , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ... '' and so forth -- he was .
my jaw was down and after i be rebounding , i said , `` i of 'd like the way , the early on the only way to be . ''
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour away with all this comes up jeans <unk> , and <unk> the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best buy , put in jeans , that i ever did .
i did it better . all these choices that allowed it me it better to have .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book is , to try it to me to myself to understand .
the reason for me , and i 'm really bad felt was , with all this available ways , my expectations of that , which for looking at a few jeans in is , went up .
i had very low expectations . i did not a concrete expectations , as it you just in a way , there .
when you in a hundred species that came to damn , one of you 'd been perfect hardware , should ,
and what i got was good , but it was n't perfect .
and so by side , i what i 'll have had to the top of what i expected , and what i do was getting there in comparison to the top of what i expected .
this add some of opportunities in the life the people , increase power is the expectations of the people have about how well , these opportunities to be .
and this leads to less great satisfaction with the results , even when the results are good .
nobody in the world of <unk> know this . because , if you it would , you knew what they all do n't it what it here goes .
the truth is more like this one .
the reason is , that used everything was better than anything worse , was , than anything worse , was , it was for the people can try to experience to make the a pleasant surprise that were .
nowadays , in the world in the we live -- we 're wealthy , one thing that citizens , with perfection , as an expectation -- the best for that you ever hope you can do is the things that well , are like you do it of you expect .
you 'll never pleasant surprised . because your expectations , my expectations , <unk> are .
the secret to the <unk> -- that 's for what they all come are -- the secret to the <unk> are low expectations .
i want to say -- a short <unk> moment -- that i do with a woman , married , i 'm , and they really is very wonderful .
i of , it could n't do better can . and i really not <unk> .
but they preferred 's not always been so a bad thing .
eventually , a consequence of making <unk> a bad at recognizing jeans , if it just a way to buy there is that , if you that way . are , and , you want to ask why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would have you can do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of jeans are available , and they buy a the getting there is , and they ask why , who 's in ?
it 's also very clear that the answer to the question is , you .
they would have it better can do .

and so , when people make decisions , and also if the results make decisions are good , you feel politics . disappointed about , they actually to themselves .
clinical depression , exploded in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of the depression , and also the suicide , this is that people know you have the getting there are because their standards , so high stress . and then , if they range , these experiences , even explain to the fact , you think it would be your fault .
and that 's kind <unk> , it to make us , generally better goes , objective , and we might bad feeling .
so let me take you remember .
this is the official dogma , that one that we all for us really hold , completely false . it 's not true .
there 's no question , that something that choice is better than no , but it follows are not , the more selection is better than something that choice .
there 's a magical lot . i do n't know what it 's .
i 'm really quite sure that we this point have just missed have to any given the selection of our public good long way .
now , as a charter of the question -- i 'm almost finished -- as a charter of the question , the thing about the thinking is . that what all these choices to take place in the industrialized world societies , is the material that wealth .
there 's a lot of spaces in the world , and we have of many of you heard , whose problem is not the beginning to be large selection is .
your problem is to keep them to little green .
so the things about the i 'm talking about are a very odd thing with the modern , rich , that of societies .
and what 's so extremely frustrating and very annoying is : steve levitt , has you briefly yesterday about it tells how these more expensive and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i 'm telling you is that that 's expensive , complicated , making -- it 's not easy , that they do n't help .
they do actually hurt .
they 're going out of this is that we got worse , standing there .
if something of the top of what the people in our society to not so decisions , to come to the societies in which people to a bit more choices we 've shifted that would , would not only that live in the people increases , but our brains would also be improved .
economists call this one <unk> amazed .
<unk> will give to worry that it is all the better goes -- not just the poor -- because all these large variety of us an educational .
by saying , read you mind these cartoon , and , a sophisticated person , says , `` ah ! what you know this fish ?
you know it not possible in this <unk> . ''
<unk> imagination , a shortsighted view of the world -- and that 's the way as i do it first you read , to have .

because the truth is that , if you that <unk> break , so that everything is possible , you have no freedom . they have a lesion .
if you that <unk> break , so that everything is possible to reduce you the average happiness .
they increase the lesion , and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost with <unk> security to be limited -- possibly also for the fish , definitely for us .
but that <unk> be from a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for the children , , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i talked about some of these projects are already mentioned before the talk , over the genome and what this mean , could , and over the discovery of new groups of genes .
actually start , we of a new point : we have the biology and digitized , and now , we try from the digital code in a new phase of biology to get into the ways we new life create , and build .
we 've always trying to a significant questions to imagine .
what 's life ? it 's something , in what i think that many biologists have tried to understand and this on the different levels .
we have different approaches tried to throw it comes up on the minimum components to simplify them .
we have nearly 20 years of digitized . when we that <unk> sequenced have <unk> fact , the transition from the analog world of biology to the digital world , the computer .
now we 're trying to ask , whether we live regenerate can or whether we new life to create an , from this digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , the the smallest genome of a species has sort of the to itself in the lab to replicate it can . and we 've tried to see if we that with a still a smaller genome can achieve .
we 've done it on about a hundred genes to give up from the 500 or so , that i 'm here .
but if we take those metabolic map , watch that are very pretty straightforward is , in comparison to our . you can trust me , that 's pretty straightforward . but if we were all those genes , watch that we speak one after the other to eliminate can it 's very unlikely that this to a living cell lead to fall .
therefore we 've gone determined that it is the only way , looking forward is this chromosome in fact , to synthesize , which allows us the line of components to <unk> and be some of those fundamental basic questions to imagine .
and so we started to time with the question , we can a chromosome , synthesize patterns ?
it 's allowed the chemistry of these really big molecule to create what 's still never been done before ?
and , if we can do that , we in the chromosome out to start ?

our first steps at the phone digitization of life in were growing exponentially .
our ability of genetic code to write , which , very slowly developed , but nevertheless , increased . and our final point was going now on an exponential curve , sit down .
we 've got 15 years ago , so i started .
it took actually a few years , starting with a <unk> review , before we the first experiments , and did .
how naturally , turned out there 's <unk> hard .
there 's tens of machines are around , around the world , the little pieces of dna to build this can , 30 to 50 letter a long , but it 's a <unk> process , so ever known for you a piece of power , you cut more error happen .
so we had a new method to come up with the we these little pieces together on and the error correct could .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information that means that the genome phi x 174 countries .
it 's a little virus that the bacteria and killing .
so we made a small pieces , made a <unk> and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the compelling phase , came when we this piece <unk> we simply were eating and in a bacterium board , and that bacteria that began the genetic code to read and made a viral particles .
the viral particles that were then of cells of this guy 's and they came back and killed , e. coli .
recently i did with the <unk> spoken and they said that you this model , just <unk> .
they were laughing , more than her , it 's where does .
so we think that its a situation is in the software in fact that , your hardware can build in a biological system .
but we wanted still much would go on . we want a which is my <unk> chromosome , building . it has more than <unk> letter of genetic code . so we thought we said , we build it in <unk> of the size of what the virus , which means we the size <unk> <unk> able to try to understand what the line of components of a living cell phones are .
design is the key , and if you with digital information in computers will just want to generate these digital information , really way , and be .
when we the genome for the first in 1995 , sequence have was the <unk> arrive at a mistake per 10,000 base pairs .
we found the can <unk> 30 mistakes . if we the <unk> sequence to use it would have it would never been possible <unk> .
a part of the art is it , pieces to create the minimum of letters for how are and the with other <unk> pieces overlap , can have to cut into smaller <unk> asked to do with these go together .
we have a unique elements of this is built into .
you might have heard that we <unk> into an accident .
you think about it for : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> this letter -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino ; and here , there 's a single what matters for each of amino acids .
so we in the genetic code using anymore to our words to write , sentences , thoughts .
initially we 've only signed .
some people were being very much that 's no new poetry was .
we have the pieces , so for how that we do you just with enzymes , though they could . it there are enzymes are the this repair and back to stitch back .
and we 've started pieces to create , starting with pieces , the five to <unk> letters <unk> , added these other people , if to <unk> to make them to get these back to self-assemble , the way to <unk> .
in every step , we have these pieces in the surplus produced by that we do you sequence we could , because we looked at a very robust process to create what you in a minute to see .
we 've tried to the point of the <unk> to get there .
so , this is sort of like a <unk> .
if we 're going to these get really big rises to get to -- with over 100,000 pairs in -- to then this is not just in e. coli that grow . it adds up all possibilities of the modern molecular biology . and so we went away that we need another mechanisms to .
we knew from a mechanism for the <unk> <unk> is called , the the biology is used to type dna to fix that were doing these pieces stitch can .
here 's a example of them . there 's a large organism , called <unk> <unk> the three million wheel will to radiation and survived .
you see in the upper field that his chromosome , just really just drops .
12 , up 24 hours later , which , everything again , like this is kind of how it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms that can totally <unk> be , you can even in a vacuum life .
i 'm absolutely certain that live in space that exists , little can move , on the quest for <unk> conditions .
indeed , the nasa has shown that it 's a lot of them out there , there .
here 's a <unk> way in the molecule that we 've created by we these processes that have used -- actually , we 've just <unk> used with the right design the pieces we have you <unk> . yeast , adds up that then automatically comes together .
this is not <unk> it 's a <unk> micrograph of .
it 's such a big molecule that we keep it even with the <unk> can see .
that are those images about a whole duration of six seconds .
this is the <unk> that we just recently finished have asked .
that are about <unk> letters of just hiding the code . it 's the largest molecule , with <unk> structure that ever of people who was created .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we do it with a <unk> of 10 and without the distances of print would would it <unk> sides to embrace , just to make these genetic code <unk> .
now , how to start we have a chromosome out ? how we activate it ?
obviously this is that it with a virus , very pretty straightforward is . it 's much more complicated with bacteria to deal .
it 's also very much easier if you put it in <unk> how we do it are doing is : you take just the nucleus out and there was one else inside , and this is that 's exactly what they all over the advantage of know about .
what in <unk> is that chromosome in the cell , integrated , but recently , we have shown that you a complete transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another that can make and these things activate it can .

this new chromosome went in the cell .
actually thought we 've seen that 's where the end is , but we 've tried to the process is a bit further to earth .
this is the <unk> the evolution , here .
we find all kinds of species here that have a second chromosome taken have or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of characteristics in just a second to a species <unk> .
people so , the road , evolution can imagine , as a gene that 's going to a moment you need to change will have a lot of the biology missed .
there 's enzymes are the <unk> be called the fact , dna and digest .
that chromosome out that in the cell was has n't keep ; the chromosomes , that we added to have already .

it <unk> , hard blue , because of the genes that we added had .
and after a very short time i did it all the characteristics of the species lost and <unk> completely in a new species , based on the new software that we in the cell have given .
all these proteins and changed the road , the membranes and changed , it’s -- when we the genetic code , all read , it was that 's exactly what we sought to have .
it may sound like the genomic <unk> sound , but we can , by we the <unk> move that , things quite dramatic change .
now , i argues that this is not the <unk> is -- that 's based on 3.5 billion years of evolution .
and i argues that we possibly have , and we 're a new form of the cambrian explosion to create in the it 's massive whole new <unk> based on this digital media design that there might .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty clearly in terms on what we need .
we 're and first of six and to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
so to it in my connection to ask : i was then , in 1946 , born .
today are three people on this planet for each of the then , in 1946 exists , has ; within of 40 years will it 's four be .

it is a challenge that for nine to offer .

if we think about the biological processes to think , or any process of them to the to replace , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there 's looked at the co2 from this material that in the atmosphere , goes .
we 've now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database , with about 20 million of genes , and i want to believe in it predicts that the <unk> the future are .
the <unk> had a dozen components and see , you want the diversity , among the way , it was invented .
we 're going to hit here in your first line , among the edges of biological reality and so , you are for our imagination .
we 've now technologies , because of this rapid <unk> to knock that to do what we <unk> genetics will call .
we 've now the possibility of a big robots to build the millions of chromosomes to the one day , make it can .
if you . they can imagine those 20 million different kinds of genes are making or those evolutionary processes to optimize them to get octane making or drugs new vaccines , we can do with a just small team more molecular biology to change as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we can use to <unk> <unk> , production of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is a micrograph of that 's really <unk> , among the we work , with the you . they can actually sit down and new species on the computer to design <unk>
you know , we could n't necessarily as it will look . we know exactly how do their genetic code looks like this is .
what we are now on fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently , corn to be ethanol seen what 's just a bad tv experiment is .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation of the relatively soon it 's coming out to be the much higher <unk> have to be , like octane or different types of <unk> .
but , how we think , the only way , so biology is a big impact without another spike in the cost on a food or the limitation of the spaces between availability will have is , if we co2 as a source material can see , and therefore we work , those cells that these going away ,
and we think that we the first with <unk> the fourth generation who will be , and that in about 18 months .
the sunlight and co2 are a method --
but -- in our discovery of the world , we 've all species on this one of ways .
this is an organism the we 1996 , described this year .
he lives in the deep , about <unk> miles deep , surely , almost <unk> <unk> .
it turned into carbon dioxide in methane to stick under the use of of hydrogen as energy source .
we study whether we <unk> co2 we can use , which simply to <unk> brought to be able to convert that co2 in the fuel , which to this process to power .
within a short time period , we think , we could in the be able to one of basic questions of life in to solve .
you know , we 've really -- <unk> goals , like the time you substitute the entire petrochemical industry . exactly when you do n't that at ted i could do , where else ? a <unk> the energy use .
but just as we work currently working on this , the same two approaches for the evolution of vaccines to stand .
they have it this year with the flu , seen , we 're always a year in the back has done and have a dollar to little bit , if it comes to the right lasts all about .
i think that 's the change it can be done by showing you <unk> vaccines , in sufficient created .
this is it , like the future , possibly could look with changes , can now the <unk> accelerated to be with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and maybe some <unk> .
we are light years of them away from people to innovate . our goal is it was merely saying that we have a chance long enough to survive to find that potentially to do . thanks !
on the last ted conference , i put an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised you back to come , for me to explain how the machine works .
now , it 's so as far . and for all those the time was n't there were , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment , which you ever been approached by thinking -- 27 miles in diameter .
his job is it , the conditions to create , which is less than a <unk> second , after the turn the universe <unk> -- and that the way to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just what breathtaking very poor .
this is the machine , below of geneva .
we take pictures of these <unk> in the detectors on .
( in this , i work . he called road , atlas detector -- 44 , up in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here 's a spectacular picture of making atlas off in the construction , so you the scaled to see .
at the 10 . september , so last year went off the machine to the first time to time .
and this picture was from an atlas taken .
it was making is huge <unk> in control room .
it 's a picture of what the first <unk> which the entire route to find the lhc <unk> , then on keeping with a part of the lhc <unk> to pick a rain from the particles , on the detector <unk> to them .
in other words , when we made this at the 10 . september they saw , we knew that one of the machine works , what it just a victory is .
i does n't know , whether this the biggest <unk> generated , or this , when someone the google side to build the and the front page , so , who was .

about a week later , there 's a problem with the machine , which with these <unk> here to do had -- this golden wires in here .
those wires run <unk> <unk> when the machine on <unk> involved .
now , the engineers , given you will you look at and say , `` no , that do n't you . that are small wires . ''
you can that could afford , because it if you very far cooling , they going to call the <unk> .
we looked at minus <unk> degrees , so , cooler than the space between the stars , can see those wires in the tension and endurance .
in one of the connections , between about <unk> magnet inside of the lhc , there 's a <unk> .
so by drag to start to the wires in slightly and <unk> <unk> away with a sudden <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , all this is still <unk> if you imagine , that the magnet about 20 tons weigh , little while to have nothing . 30 inches shifted .
we do it were so about 50 the magnet
and they had to remove , what we also did .
we <unk> they 're going to say , <unk> you .
they 're now all back on their way back .
against the end of the march is the lhc , again <unk> be .
we 're going to him turn up , and expecting the first data in june , or maybe july and collect the way to , and put our journey continues to knock out what the building blocks away from the universe are .
now , of course , on a way that stressed are those accidents , once again , the debate to present value of the science and <unk> of events such planetary boundaries . it 's easy , so something to reject .
i think the fact that 's so hard is , the fact that we about our planetary boundaries beyond our grasp , you create value of the things like the the lhc .

thank you .
i 'm a writer .
books to write is my profession , but it 's kind of course , more than that .
it 's also my big , into my love and fascination .
and i do n't expect , they said , i knew that ever change is .

this appear to this incident was , that i recently wrote a book , to have -- a biography called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- , that , decided to different than all my previous books from for some reason , in the world in a more and a big <unk> , international <unk> was .
the result is that i do , matter where i come to treat it 'll as if i think , the <unk> <unk> .
seriously -- the the <unk> <unk> !
for instance , they can get very concerned on me to and say , `` if you are n't you to this success never outstrip be ?
you have no longer afraid of that they all their lives <unk> and never again a book , create , that anybody in the world has been interested in ? never again ? ''
okay , this is also really the courage .
it would be however , even worse , if i told me to do n't remember this would be that i 'm in about 20 years , when i was a teenager 's the first time of them told me , and i writer , wanted to be , with the same kind of <unk> response faced been 'm .
the people said , were you do you not afraid , never succeeded , to have ?
you no fear , that you , the humiliation of one of rejection killing ?
you no fear , you to make this craft , your life for <unk> and that they have never get a bit of creation and you to make them on a <unk> <unk> dreams are dying , going -- as your mouth is filled with the bitter ashes in the space failure ? ''
so roughly , you know already .
the answer -- the short answer on these questions is : <unk>
yes , i fear ago all those things .
and that i had always .
and i ago , still much more things that fear , that no <unk> would .
how algae -- and other <unk> things .

is that as to ?
it 's logical that 's part of someone would expect that should be , that he was afraid of has , the work to do to the he 's going to start demanding professions feel ?
and what exactly is with the creative minds around and we go you to us into uncertainty about the other 's <unk> do -- in a way , how it other professions have n't do ?
my father , the example , was a chemist , and i can tell me of not a situation in his dream 40 years as a chemist , remember , in the he was asked , if he fear that would have , chemist to be .
with outside your <unk> , john -- how it 's hear from you with it ?
it just came not ago , you know ?
but to clear fair to be -- the group of the chemist who have over the centuries , not the reputation of <unk> <unk> people get .
we hire writers may seem , but these kinds of call you have them . but not just the writer , but the creative in spite of genres , it seems like this call to have , mental , hugely you have the measure .
everything , what they need to do , is , naturally , the bitter <unk> of really great the minds from just the the in the 20th century . look at me , the young and often of up their own hand , died .
and even the ones who do n't actually <unk> <unk> , the tracks of their talents really have neglected and been to be .
norman <unk> said , a moment ago , he died in his last interview : <unk> my books , has me a little further <unk>
an extraordinary statement that they do about her life 's can do .
but we <unk> n't even , if we find someone that was going to tell you hear , because we all these kinds of statements i 've been so long time to know . somehow we have the african attitude and so i moved and collective , acceptable , that creativity and i 'm sorry , kind of course <unk> and that art -- the end -- always starts to <unk> the table .
the question , i went today in right here to ask you want is : is this idea for them completely in order ?
you feel politics . comfortable with ? because with only one inch by and at them — i feel with this attitude , do not comfortable .
i find they become really .
and i find them too dangerous . and i do n't want to watch , as you go on the next century , acquired by 2027 .
i find it better , if we our big creative encourage living .
and i know definitely , that it for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to be saying , with anybody , this dark straight in the things will , so to <unk> -- especially in the the situation that , in the the time i was in my career working on the am .
that means -- you see : i 'm pretty too young . i 'm only about . 40 years old .
i may still another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely likely that everything , what i went from now , seen going to write from the world as the work they rank is a , after the <unk> success of my last book came , right ?
i say it straightforward , because we 're here , yes , now all kind of friends -- it 's most likely to get off my greatest success behind me is very much .
oh , jesus , which for a thought !
these are the kind of thoughts , the someone to wonder we can do anything to 9 a.m get up with anybody , <unk> to drink . and that i want , i do n't .
i 'd better to continue this work to do , that i love .
so is the question : how ?
eventually , '' of <unk> seem to me that i do anything to continue to write the way to , a kind of <unk> psychological are building design must .
somehow i have to from now there to find a way , the can write a safe distance to the true connection between me and my very natural <unk> about , like the response on the <unk> will be .
while i in the past year after the models for that were seeking , to have to knock that to do , i 've also in the past , looking for and i tried to other societies find , , to see , if you know , we might better or <unk> ideas about it did when we of how to creative can help , with the emotional risks to deal , the with the creativity to them .
those search led me into the old greece and the old rome .
well you follow them to me , because the circle going to start to be back to close .
but in an ancient greece and rome , people have not believed that one of creativity of people coming , okay .
they believed that creativity of , <unk> <unk> was the heat from a distant , and unknown source to the people coming -- from <unk> , and unknown reasons .
the greeks called them that kind of divinity <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from socrates is known that he 's what it was believed , he would have a <unk> , the it , the wisdom from favelas and there at age in which .
the roman had the same idea , why we do that kind of <unk> of creative spirit of a <unk> .

they believed that a genius , that way , magical divine beings who was , any of the thought this was that it is literally in the walls of a <unk> lives -- about as if you <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the the artists speak at the work that kind of the invisible <unk> and the outcome of labor to design would .
that 's brilliant -- there is it , there 's the distance , of the i talked about -- the psychological construct a , you learn from the consequences and to your work to protect .
and everybody knew that it this worked , right ?
the artists in the space <unk> was front of a certain things protected , like , the example , to a lot <unk> , right ?

if your work <unk> -- not entirely , your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , as your genius , was something <unk> .
so , people have in the west really long time about creativity thought .
and then came the renaissance and everything changed to go . we had this great idea . and this great idea was : let us the human individual the shopping center of what the universe , imagine -- about all the gods and mystery . and there 's no room , more for the unicorn creatures , the orders from the divine assume .
it 's the and at the rational humanism , and the people started to believe that creativity is completely gone from their own individual needs came .
for the first time in the story to hear you people on this , or measure of artists , a genius call -- instead of them that he 's a genius from .
i must tell you : i think , that was a big mistake .
you know ? i think , a was given person to allow me , and he thinks , he or she was more like that having been , like the pelvis and the essence , and the root of all the divine , creative , <unk> , an infinite <unk> is a little tiny , too much responsibility to move them a <unk> , human psychology of an even .
it 's how someone to ask , the sun to swallow .
that be misdirected intention and distorted by all our egos , and it is creating all these <unk> expectations of the side of success .
i think that 's this <unk> our artists , the last 500 years <unk> has .
and , if this is true , -- and i think , it 's true -- is the question :
we make this change ?
maybe going to a we’ve understanding about the relationship between humans and the the mystery of what the creative ways to return .
maybe not .
maybe we can that <unk> from 500 years , rational humanism , not just in a <unk> talk , the chance .

i 'm probably not all of them on this journey , you can take .
but the question , i went by posing want is : why not ?
why not so thinking about it ?
because it makes the same amount of sense like anything other , any of the i heard of have , if it 's why they went to the absolutely crazy <unk> <unk> years of the creative process to understand .
a process , the road , -- like everybody knows , the it ever has tried to something to make -- so in other words : actually , everyone here -- not always as to behave .
, indeed , it could form , sometimes is literally <unk> they feel .
i had recently a sense to encounter , when i the extraordinary example , in poet <unk> stone , i met a , well over 90 is a , but all their lives for about poet was . they told me , that you when in <unk> virginia , growing up out the fields have worked . they said , they would feel and to listen as a poem written about the landscape on them <unk> .
they said it would like a <unk> train from the air ,
the talk about the country on them <unk> would .
they felt , if it came , because it would the earth , under their feet , to <unk> bring .
they knew that they 're in a such a moment , just one of could do . and this was -- in her words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran out how the devil , to the house while you from this poem been to . it was about the only about giving you to quickly enough to a piece of paper and a pen , into had , so they it , if it through them <unk> to capture , and on the sheet onto could .
what in another painting was n't you fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they achieved the house , not and the poem and she would through them and you missed it . they said it would keep talking about the country , pull , and -- how they said -- <unk> with a different poet <unk> .
and then there 's these moments -- the part i will never forget -- they said , that it moments , there in which they it almost missed .
so : they 're running out to the house and for game the construction paper and the poem , which goes through them and they 're reaching out a pencil -- just as it through them <unk> and then -- i said , you -- it was so when i 'd love with their other hand , then we reach and it to stick to get more .
you five miles the poem that sort of his tail and moved it back in your body and it 's took on the kind of paper .
out in these times that came the poem reciprocal and intact , on the paper , together -- but it backwards -- from last word for the first .
when i think that i heard that i thought , `` that 's creepy -- that 's exactly , like my creative process <unk>
this is , it does n't like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel !
i 'm a <unk> . so to work to can i have to every day to the same time to get up and sweat to me to struggle to and really pretty uncomfortable <unk> .
but even i held in <unk> of have sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess that many of you that 's also have done .
even i had to work or ideas that go from a source by me <unk> , that i really do n't identify can .
what is that for a thing ?
and how we step , so in the relationship with no about our minds to lose , but for us in the opposite , even imagined in mental states , health to balance ?
for me is the best of living for example of how to this to make it can the musician and tom <unk> . i for letting him some years ago for a magazine interview .

but then it became the older and they settled . he told me that he 's one day on a <unk> in go to los angeles was driving . and there , everything changed for him .
he went down with high speed as he suddenly , threw a fragment of a tune we want you , the , how it , in my inspirations are often is , for him <unk> hard it away is . and he wants to have them . she 's gorgeous . he <unk> after , but he can you ca n't believe .
he has not a piece of paper , he has n't a pen , he has no recorders .
he starts so , those old <unk> in him up from , like for example . , `` i 'm going to this thing to lose and i 'm coming from this song on forever are tracking .
i 'm not good enough , i can do it '' a
but rather than in to panic of early detection , he heard just on .
he ended up all the <unk> and did something completely new .
he looked up just in the sky and said , <unk> , can you do n't see that i car to drive ? ''
<unk> i was so from when i could i just a song it down ?
if you 've really exist and you want to come to a <unk> moment , again , if i told me to direct hits you care can .
if not , <unk> today , somebody else .
you go , and <unk> leonard <unk>
be your whole <unk> which , after that changed .
not the work itself . that was to continue to a lot like this dark matter how it has always and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> , the him to see around , was pick up when he was the genius from here , this out it took , where he 's nothing more than the trouble was making and it , until that betrayal , where he 'd like , you came from . he realized that it is not a skilled , <unk> thing had to be .
it could be a <unk> , miraculous , bizarre , with me to give , a kind of conversation between tom , and the the <unk> , <unk> thing , that 's not very tom was .
when i do this story about this one of have changed it also a bit of the way , as i worked and it has made me already , even have saved .
this idea that saved me when i right in <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> was . i fell in one of these dug out over the <unk> in the we all the fall , if we of something to work and it does n't worked out . , you <unk> to continue to think that it is a disaster is . this is the worst book , that ever was written .
not just bad , but to develop the worst , all time .
i started to think , i should the project , just <unk> .
but then i remembered that sort of like tom opens onto the free the sky , talking about how did and i tried it .
i picked up so my view from the manuscript , and talked my i 'd be in the direction of an empty the corner of making room .
i spoke out loud : `` stop to , you running thing , you and i know , both , if this book , not brilliant , this is that 's not completely my fault , is , right ?
because you look so yes , that i do everything , what i , <unk> . i 'm not even more than that .
if you get it so much we have you want to , i got to you here show up and find your percentage of the deal , <unk> .

i 'm still continues to write , because this is my job .
and i want to ask them to protocol from giving that i do today for my part of the jobs here <unk>
because ... ... the end it 's how to follow . centuries ago , have been wondering , in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> with the sacred and music and music , gathered around that hours , and ran were -- the way to <unk> .
this fixed these were always been great , because the dancers were highly professional and they were fantastic .
but to do , and again , very rare , on is something special . one of the performer , was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know , what i mean , because i know that they all in their lives have ever again that sort of performance , have seen .
it was when i would have the time <unk> and the dancer , through a kind of <unk> step . he did n't something different than he 's ever before has done -- a thousand , nights earlier . but everything we added , they 've got together .
and very suddenly appeared he did n't even more than any longer we went in human .
he was from within lights up and of the bottom , illuminating , and everything is lit the road , through a divine fire .
when that was going back then happened , we knew the people what it was . they called it at its name .
they put all the hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , <unk>
this is god , you know ?
interesting , historical buy it : when the <unk> <unk> <unk> they brought down this practice , with . the way it changed the road , in the course centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that you still born in <unk> and <unk> hear .
if a performer , in spain , something <unk> , something magic has done : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> it 's amazing , there is it : a glimpse into view on god .
and that 's amazing , because we need that .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , if the dancer ourselves up and do to see is that it comes at 11 , looking at a tuesday -- is -- and he did n't no longer a <unk> of god in here , this is wearing .
he is merely a an aging mortal with <unk> at , . and maybe he will never again to these times and rising up .
and perhaps will never again , from a god 's names are calling , if he was wondering , turns out . but what should he then with the rest of his life to start ?
that 's hard .
this is a the <unk> done some of a creative life .
but maybe it must not very much as full of the anguish be , if you from the beginning of pollution did n't believe that we 've seen that the most extraordinary things , and so , of being , of you move it .
if you might just believe that you a loaner are -- from one even imagined a source for a <unk> time your life , the edges of someone else , down is , if you 've done it are .
if we start , so going to think it changes all this .
so i 've begun to think , and so i think with safety in the past few months , while i 'm able to the the book working , that soon find out , is -- as the dangerous to appetite , strong , i expected <unk> of my <unk> success .

do n't be <unk> .
just do your job .
be to continue for about your contribution there , what do anything that he would be and hope .
when your job that dance is , the dance .
if , i knew that stupid divine genius , that you so on the side of really is to decide , for her a moment a , and yet from the miracles through your effort to show , then <unk> ! there ? ''
and if not , the dance , yet put your dance .
and <unk> ! '' so for you , despite all this to .
i think this thing , and i feel like this , we should be the teaching .
<unk> ! '' so for you , despite all this to , just to mess , you the mere human universal love and the <unk> talk about it , for that there to be .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i have both these slides , shown to stand for us to realize that the arctic <unk> on to the close , three million years of the size of the bottom of 48 states had anything to 40 percent gone down is .
but this back there 's not be strong enough to the seriousness , this particular problem , from , there 's not the thickness of the arctic sea ice is the world .
in a sense , is the arctic <unk> that beating heart of our global <unk> .
you grows in winter and <unk> in summer .
the next slide that i do you 'll show , is a <unk> what in the last 25 years 's happened .
that <unk> is with the red is neatly .
as you see , growing , it on the blue is to highlight . this is that year by ice in winter ; and it <unk> in summer .
that 's called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which , from the body , here <unk> .
in 25 years will it from here , wait here 's gone to be .
this is a problem , because the warming the frozen reason relates to the arctic ocean <unk> , in the the it , very large amounts of <unk> carbon out there , which one , when he <unk> , of microbes out to methane , it has will .
comparing with the entire amount of the best <unk> filaments in the atmosphere , could be wondering , this , which will double , if we 've got this critical point that cross .
already today <unk> in some of shallow lakes in alaska and methane itself from the water .
professor <unk> walter the university in alaska 's with of another task force to take a different shallow seas last winter , across .
wow !
her , it goes well . the question is , how would have to us , running through .
and a reason is , this enormous <unk> up with the greenland , from the north .
this is a <unk> <unk> .
but the volume , are you much bigger than ever .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know , like the heavens through <unk> goes up here <unk> you the ocean .
those rivers , take a revolution to .
at the other end of what the planet , the antarctica , the biggest <unk> on the planet .
last month had signed up , scientists , that the entire continent now a negative <unk> has .
and the <unk> , the about a few <unk> show up is , is particularly am strong in the melting .
this is equivalent to 20 to walk the sea level , as in greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> <unk> , you see up new lakes , the front of a few years glaciers were .
40 percent of all people on the world get the half of their <unk> out of this <unk> .
in the andes , is this glacier , the <unk> for this town .
the <unk> have to start to <unk> .
but if you <unk> , will also the most of drinking water <unk> .
in california was a 40 percent decrease reduction in <unk> the sierra seen .
this from in the <unk> .
and the predictions , as you do you read have , are seriously .
this <unk> in the whole world that leads to a dramatic increase of wood fire .
and the catastrophe , all around the world have in a really <unk> and she 'd never an unprecedented <unk> gained .
times as many in the last 30 years , like in the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you this in the historical context of yourself , they can see , what it <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of hit co2 produced at all of 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
look , you want to the area means that the eastern pacific , right , despite the nation state in the continent , becomes , and both sides of years of the indian <unk> , where it 's a drastically decline of making the oxygen in the ocean and there .
the biggest single factor for the global warming , next to logging , which is 20 percent believe is , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is that 's nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are one of those two major <unk> , along with china .
and the suggestion was , many more <unk> to build .
but we start , a change to see .
here are the shift , in recent years , painted by virtue , with some green are alternatives , the suggested that were .
<unk> there 's a political engagement in in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> on doing anything to clean coal to apply to what 's going to start already a contradiction in here , this is .
this picture reminded me of something .
that is the christmas around walked over , me to home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> from .
they have it <unk> in the news seen .
this is in our whole country in the <unk> <unk> america .
this happened to see the christmas .
one of the commercials , the <unk> , to a christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happier -- what does .
it , there 's in the shell and abundance of in america , and he helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> going every day , clean .
he is affordable , and <unk> , and the workers will remain in wages , and bread .
this is the source of the most of coal in west virginia .
the most powerful <unk> is the heads of <unk> coal , .
, let me of a very clear to say . al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they do n't know , in what they talk .
so has the alliance for <unk> two campaigns to sleep in '' .
this is one , a part of her .
it at the <unk> we see the climate change , as a serious at risk for our business .
why we 've it gives us to the top <unk> posed , a significant <unk> spending dropped to a <unk> on the way to bring anything to the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is not really messy .
we think , she 's clean -- and it smells are also still good .
so , do , you want n't worry about the radiation to climate .
leave you the quiet for us .
<unk> coal , they have a lot to hear about it .
so let them to us a tour of these modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of the clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal , one of the main reasons for the global warming is , the remarkably , clean <unk> , that you see here , it changes everything .
if you look at it , i knew exactly , despite this is the world today , clean <unk> .
finally grew up and the road , the positive alternative , with our economic challenge and our challenge the national security .
america 's in a crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the major thread , the these all connecting , is our dependence of <unk> <unk> like the dirty and coal and <unk> oil .
but now there 's a bold , new solution which to us from this <unk> able to be free .
<unk> america with 100 percent cleaner , electricity to examine , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america , back to work to bring to us safer to make and to help , the global warming continues to stop .
finally , a solution , the big enough is , our to solve problems .
<unk> america in new . they find more out .
this is the last thing .
it goes to find a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest ways , our dependence of the old , diapers <unk> , the our world suffocated , to reduce .
the future is here . wind , the sun and a new energy system .
new investment , which to well , and paid for jobs to create .
<unk> america in new . it 's time , reality to embrace .
there 's a old african saying : `` if you be fast want us , `` go alone .
if you too far come to do want to go , together . ''
we need to go far come to the world , which quickly .
thank you .
i want to begin with to ask them to with the time your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> played .
while they realized of how to the hands are rising and <unk> , the <unk> pick up and moves , they learned in fact , to think about , and problems through the understanding and change the spatial now actually to solve .
the spatial can think is closely with being connected spaces , we have a majority of our environment to understand .
as a computer scientist -- inspired from the kind of our interaction with real physical objects -- together with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , , i started to be wondering : what would , if we use computers would shift , instead of a <unk> , the road , as a digital <unk> on a flat tie these moves ... ... what would , if we do with both hands to intervene could and data , physically <unk> and they were so , put them could , how we do it want ?
this question was like that 's emotional , that we wanted to the study of the answer is going on and <unk> developed .
in short , a <unk> is a more interactive computer in the size of <unk> .
you can with the hand be moved , you can range , each perceive , you can get their motion capture and they have a screen and a <unk> .
much more important : are are physically , which means that you do you like <unk> merely by that reach the hands and to access can move .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> to the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools <unk> be and a consciousness for your movement to develop , naturally , each of see , and the intricacies of our <unk> with you can perceive , then we can share with the study of new soil and <unk> <unk> start .
i 'll start with some simple design examples of pollution .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i told him in a direction <unk> , is the video went forward to change it ; if i told him in the other way <unk> , running , it backwards .
and this interactive portraits should take the road , becomes true .
if i do you so close together horribly , it makes me that their interest .
if you <unk> are surrounded , we realize you that again , and you can a little nervous be .
and they feel there as their movements and slope .
an interesting a consequence of the interactions , that we 're going to see it started , was that we keep everyday gestures on the data we use it could , how about color so to them into the of how to this with <unk> does .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can you use anything to paint in the in the center to pour , where they then mixed it will .
if we do it carried , we can get a little <unk> .


this is a game with words , that sort of a mixture of <unk> and <unk> is .
basically , you get each round on every <unk> random <unk> letters and while you 're trying to words to form , be this talk about a dictionary went through .
then , after about 30 seconds , is back mixed and you has a new <unk> and new ways to try .
thank you .
that are some kids that on a trip to the media lab and ended up . i could you can use to move , it to try and what you have a video of it 's taken .
they have it really loved .
a more interesting situation that looked at this kind of applications is that , you to the people not a lot of instructions , there must .
everything else you say to get it 's `` it used words , '' and you know exactly what to do is .
here are still a few people , that 's test .
this is our youngest <unk> down there right .
it turned to start to out that he the <unk> just a pile i wanted .
so for him , they were just <unk> .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we want a in my own for <unk> develop .
this is <unk> .
he can create new characters in the scene bring , by he the <unk> of the picture on `` that 's in this figure shows .
here it 's when he the sun when an .
the sun goes on
now speeding up he 's a <unk> in the scene .

good job ! yeah !
by he the <unk> shake and them side puts it ca the characters and interact and let ...
i brought his own story to invent .
hello !
it 's a story with open the end , and he can decide , how do these illnesses .
flying his cat .
the last example , for that i now time , to have , it to show , is a <unk> for <unk> , that recently we 've developed and put in the <unk> as a wide , like <unk> , bass , and the drums , operate .
each has four different variations on ; you can choose , which you use want .
and you can this sounds in the sequence -- if we shift , you again in any one of pattern , put them can .
and you <unk> you a , by showing you just a <unk> to one of <unk> holding .
there are the effects , that you live can change , like for example . hall and filter .
you connect him with a particular sound , and one from him and then , to hire .
and then still <unk> effects , like the speed and the volume , that you on the entire sequence that gets .
so we can look at it .
we start to put in the way that we <unk> in two <unk> -- if we and this in a series , put them , they expand and a little bit more of the voice to add .
now in -- i have a bass , add .
now i 'm still a play drums , that to do .
and now just hook up , i the filters out with the drums , so that i the effect , live control how can .
i can the entire sequence or speed , by i was the speed in the one or other direction <unk> .
and now just hook up , i the filter is still with the bass ; for something more expression .
i can the sequence , while they 're going on out <unk> .
it does so i have to do n't you in the reservations are planning , but can improvise ; they meanwhile extend or to shrink .
and closing i can the entire sequence <unk> , by i the <unk> after the left tend to .
thank you .
so as you can see , and what is my desire to think it , new <unk> to develop , the better to the the fit , how our brains and body work .
