when steve lopez , funny , we go to los angeles times , one day , the streets in the center of going to los angeles listening to , he heard a beautiful music .
they came from a man , an african-american , <unk> , somewhere , homeless , on a violin and playing , the only still two strings , had .
many of you are the story know , because of <unk> article about it was later a book , of this movie was , robert <unk> junior , when steve lopez , jamie <unk> as nathaniel anthony <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> studied and of very promising career , sadly for us through his paranoid schizophrenia , i finished running .
nathaniel left the juilliard , suffered a <unk> and 30 years later , living it as homeless man on the streets of <unk> row in the center of going to los angeles .
i 'm going to everybody , <unk> book to read or , the film at , so they 're not just the wonderful place where we understand that between these two men that is , but also the music that make it and how they finally the instrument was , if this off the light is that <unk> , nathaniel away from the road to get one .
i 've <unk> in the years since 2008 , two years ago , in the walt disney <unk> hall .
he had just a demo of <unk> first , and fourth symphony of and came up behind the stage to , i imagine .
he was in a very <unk> and social tone of yo-yo ma , hillary clinton , and about the dodgers , it never going to the kid world series of law would . and that all for the <unk> passage of the first violin at the last sentence of <unk> fourth symphony .
we came to talk about music to talk . and a few days later i get an email , in the state that nathaniel , for <unk> , i was interesting .
i must have you say that nathaniel a medical <unk> , because he was already with <unk> and with <unk> and <unk> treated by , a trauma , that it be whole life being .
as a result of it is now , particularly prone to these schizophrenic stages . that are sometimes it gets so , and he days away , in the streets of <unk> row <unk> , this horror and the <unk> his own mind to .
and in just as a <unk> found myself , nathaniel , when we do with our first started , walt disney <unk> hall , began . he had this . flickering in his eyes and this seemed completely lost .
he talked about the invisible demons and smoke and it , how it does anyone in your sleep , too .
i was afraid , not donated , but i was afraid that i told him lose that that it in one of the conditions , get it could and that i was to its relationship to a violin destroying it could , when i started , about <unk> and <unk> and others have been an order of the <unk> <unk> to talk .
i started so easy , to play .
i played the first set of <unk> <unk> .
and while i was playing , i noticed , that in <unk> eyes a full of years ago , went .
it was , as if it underneath the impact of invisible have said , a chemical response , of the catalyst for my game .
<unk> <unk> anger , turning , in understanding , in a quiet , curiosity and the grace .
and how through a miracle , he took his violin and began to be heard some clips from <unk> to play and asked me then , you to end to play , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
we started then , about music to talk , starting from the stream of beethoven , <unk> , <unk> and all the other <unk> , of <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and i became clear that he 's not just a <unk> know about music owned , but it with her , one of personal relationship there .
he spoke of her with a passion and a deeper understanding that i would just from my colleagues in philharmonic , we go to los angeles , i know .
and he 's music playing and about music , talking , was one of <unk> , confused man , because it 's still the streets of going to los angeles moved was , a <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , in the juilliard <unk> musician .
music is medicine . music , changes us .
for nathaniel means that music <unk> health .
because the music , it allows him , his thoughts and delusions , help his imagination and creativity in a real <unk> .
and so <unk> it , who 's being .
i realized that 's what is the essence of art is .
what this is the reason , why we 're going to do : so we do something that in all of us , in the inside of us is , our feelings , by our artistic lens , by our creativity to actually shape can .
and the fact that expression of us all , and moves , inspired , and it unites us .
what nathaniel <unk> , that brought him the music back in a community of friends .
the <unk> power of music got it back in a family of musicians , it 's mind , to be a talent and i realized , and it so .
and i 'm going , with nathaniel music , no matter whether , walt disney <unk> hall , or in <unk> row , because he reminds me , why i musicians have 'm .
thank you .
bruno giussani : thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
robert gupta : i want to play , that i <unk> the <unk> stolen .
i hope , pardon me .
so i have in my life , many fishes known .
i just two loved .

it was a fish , <unk> , good it , <unk> , a best-selling book on the menu .
what for a fish .
still better , he was in <unk> after the the highest standards of sustainability from .
you could , so , and feel , it to sell it .
i had with this beauty of a sense of several months .
one day , called the head of the company , and said , if i in an event , which might think about the sustainability , the farm .
`` course , '' i said .
here was a company , the ability to trying to this incredible problem for us chefs , so it 's . how do we fish on our <unk> ?
in the last 50 years , we have the ocean out how we forests <unk> beaten up .
it 's hard to the destruction began to <unk> .
90 percent of the big fish , that we love of tuna that <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , they 're collapsed .
it 's almost nothing more left .
so is , or bad <unk> , <unk> , a part of our future .
of arguments against it . <unk> pollute the environment , the most of them anyway , and they are inefficient , we take these tuna . a big disadvantage .
he has a <unk> of 15 to one .
that is , 15 pounds <unk> are required to you a pounds <unk> get .
not very sustainable .
it tastes , not very good .
so here was finally one company , trying to it right .
i wanted you support .
the day of the event , i called the head of the <unk> for the company .
we call him , don .
`` well , don '' , i said , `` just with the facts , right to have you are famous for , so far out in the ocean as opposed to her the environment is n't stop messing up . ''
`` this is true , '' he said , `` we 're so far out that the waste of our fish you 're going to do n't quite concentrated . ''
and then put it 's add , `` we 're in basically a own world .
this <unk> of <unk> to one , '' he said .
`` the best in the industry . ''
<unk> to one , great .
`` <unk> to one of what ? what she told her ? ''
`` sustainable and proteins , '' he said .
`` great '' , i said . put on .
and , that night i was in bed and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so i the next day , in a the event , don .
i said , don , what the example are sustainable and proteins right ? ''
he said , he told her not . he 'll and of .
now , i get on with a few people in the company . nobody could tell me a 's answer , until i finally , on the biologists on .
we call him as well , don .
`` well , don '' , i said , `` what the example are sustainable and proteins right ? ''
now , he mentioned , some algae and some <unk> , and then he said , <unk> .
i said , `` <unk> ? ''
he said , `` yes , feathers to the skin , <unk> , this day , <unk> and to forage data . ''
i said , `` how much percent have consume it 's chicken ? `` well ,
in the assumption , maybe two percent .
`` well that are about 30 percent , '' he said .
i said , don , which is that chicken , fish to feed ? ''
there 's a recess during the line and he said , `` there 's easy to a chicken , the world . ''
i <unk> me from this fish .
no , not , because i was a <unk> <unk> and <unk> 'm .
that i 'm actually .
no , i <unk> fact , from this fish <unk> , because , i swear , god , the fish , this entertainment , chicken , tasted it .
this second fish , that 's a different kind of year-old .
it 's the romantic sort of the way , you , ever better if you his fish will know that learning , you the fish you cut more love .
i 've got it first in a restaurant in <unk> eaten .
a <unk> journalist who had been thinking about this fish about .
well , we kind of the <unk> .
he came on the table with a light , almost glowing in the white color .
the chef who had him <unk> .
, twice .
amazingly , he was still delicious .
who can a fish that well taste and let me , after he <unk> was ?
i ca n't it , but this guy put it .
we call him miguel , actually means he miguel .
and no , he has the fish ca n't go cook and he 's not a chef . at least on the way that you and i have to understand .
he 's a biologist in <unk> la <unk> .
this is a <unk> in the <unk> corner <unk> .
you is near the <unk> the river <unk> .
to the thing i was the farm in the hands of <unk> .
they 're domesticated <unk> on the , what , the wetlands .
they did that , by the country <unk> .
they built this complicated the result of the channels , and you who water from the country , and out into the river .
now , they could n't make that was fine , not be economically .
and how it was a catastrophe .
it brought about 90 percent of birds to , which for this place , many birds are .
and so , in a spanish company with green the country .
what they 've done ?
they have the rivers of the water , and vice versa .
they have literally the on <unk> .
instead of the water <unk> they the channels , the water again <unk> .
they <unk> the channels .
they created a thousand of <unk> -- <unk> , <unk> , shrimp , eel that -- and have miguel , and his company in the environmental destruction , vice versa .
the farm is incredible .
i mean , they have something that still never seen .
you stare out on the horizon , a million miles away is , and everything what you 're <unk> channels and this dense , lush , which has .
i was there , not too long time with miguel .
he 's a really incredible guy , three parts of charles darwin and a part `` a crocodile , kissing . ''
okay ? because we were and she fought for us through the wetlands and i <unk> and <unk> , we 've been on to my travels at , and miguel holding in peace one <unk> .
here 's one he 's a rare <unk> out .
now i said he the <unk> of phytoplankton .
and here , see here 's a pattern of split , that it , <unk> giraffe , it .
it turns out , is miguel of his career in <unk> national park in africa is this .
i asked him , he to this is a <unk> 's become .
he said , `` fish ? i know anything about the fish .
i 'm an expert , relationships . ''
and then , it and plummets , more maybe of very top of birds and algae and weird <unk> .
and , do n't get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the <unk> community <unk> , so in the way .
it 's great , but i was in love .
and my head was really about this <unk> piece here 's a fish that i the brink of had .
so i put him speak broken . i said , `` miguel , how it comes to your fish that well taste ? ''
he showed on the algae .
`` i know , boy , the algae , of phytoplankton , the relationships , this is incredible .
but what we eat your fish ?
how is the <unk> ? ''
now , it continues to me to share that it 's a rich system is that the fishes better food , what you in the wild , would .
the vegetable biomass , and phytoplankton , the <unk> , this is it , what the fish , she .
the system is so healthy , it 's completely <unk> .
there 's no food .
and space of a farm heard that they are not an ?
later on day i went on this site , miguel around and i asked him , i said , `` for a place , so , seems to be , '' different than any farm , on the i ever been was , `` how much it , you are succeeding ? ''
in the moment , it was , as if a <unk> a <unk> to have .
and we is between the corner and we provided , the most sight , thousands and pinker flamingos , literally , pinker carpet , so far the eye can see .
`` that 's success , '' he said .
`` look to their bellies on earth , pink .
they <unk> . ''
<unk> ? i was completely confused .
i said , `` miguel , <unk> they 're not your fish ? ''
`` yes , '' he said .
`` we lose within 20 percent of our fish and <unk> of the birds .
now , last year were on this site 600,000 , birds , more than 250,000 ways .
it is the largest and one of the private <unk> , europe .
i said , `` miguel , is a good <unk> <unk> not the last thing that you on a <unk> have to ? ''
he 's going , his head , no .
he said , `` we build <unk> , not hard .
this is a who network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
you , pinker so the belly more than the system . ''
okay , you make us that come . a farm , they are not an and a farm , their success of the health services to predators , it .
a <unk> , but also a <unk> .
oh , and the way to these flamingos , first place , not even be there .
they breed in a city 240 miles away , where the evaporated better , it 's <unk> .
every morning to fly them up 240 miles to farm .
and every night fly them up 240 miles back .
they do that because they the <unk> white line the highway <unk> follow .
seriously .
i had a journey of the penguins had , and i miguel , .
i said , `` miguel , fly them up 240 miles to the farm and fly , then the 240 miles back on the evening ?
they do that for the children ? ''
he looked me , as if i just a song of the whitney houston , quotes .
he said , `` no . they do that because the food is better . ''
i 'm not the skin of my beloved of the fish mentioned , delicious was , and i do n't like <unk> . i ca n't you <unk> . i like they do n't be crisp .
it 's this <unk> , <unk> flavor .
i cooking , almost never seen it .
and yet , when i told them in this restaurant in <unk> one of have , they do n't actually , <unk> tasted candy .
they did sweet and in , as if you a half bites the ocean , would .
i mentioned that to miguel , and he nodded .
he said , `` the skin it looks like a swam .
you is the last <unk> , until something into the body into .
you , over the evolution has evolved to <unk> suck . ''
and then put it 's add , `` but our drinking water has no <unk> . ''
okay . a farm , your fish are not an . a farm , their success , it is the success of its predators .
and then i was clear , when he says , a farm , no <unk> , <unk> it , because the water , that through this farm is coming from the river <unk> in .
it 's a river , all the things , leads , of rivers , that we tend to them , to lead , chemical pollutants , drain , <unk> .
and if it happen through the system , fought , and this , it 's the waters clean , how it <unk> is .
the system is so healthy , it cleans the water .
so not just a farm , they are not an , not just a farm , their success of the health services to predators , it , but a farm , literally a <unk> is , and not just for those fish , but also for you and me .
because if the water <unk> , <unk> it in the atlantic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i guess it , and that they should also do , because these year-old , like this was anything that , is also telling .
you could tell you to a recipe is the future of good food , whether we of <unk> or <unk> talk .
what we now we need , is a radical new concept of agriculture , from one , in the food in fact , taste .
but for many people like this is a little to radically changed .
we 're not <unk> , we <unk> . we 're lover .
we love <unk> . we love this little <unk> . we 're talking about local food . we eat organic .
and if they claim that the things are the future of good food it 's somebody somewhere on and says , `` hey , people , i love the pink flamingos , but how they will feed the world ?
how they will feed the world ? ''
can i be honest ?
i like this question is not .
no , not , because we have enough calories are producing the world more than just to feed .
one billion people are today <unk> .
one billion -- this is more than ever before -- because <unk> inequalities , in the distribution , not the <unk> .
now , i like this question is not , because they the logic of our <unk> the last 50 years of all are .
feed the grain of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , chemicals , the earth , grilled chicken , fish , and the sort of the agribusiness , just wondered : `` if we more people who do you feed , how awful can it be ? ''
that was the <unk> . it was the , which is . it was the plan that the american agriculture .
we should they call , what you is , if you in <unk> , if you really , that fast , who end of its , and that this production to .
this is not if you really , and it 's not invent agriculture .
our <unk> is threatened , not because <unk> <unk> , but because <unk> resources ,
not by the latest <unk> and <unk> , but through a fertile one country , not by pumps , but through fresh water , not by the chainsaws , but through the forests , and not by were doing and nets , it by the fish in the ocean .
they want to feed the world ?
let them to start with the question : how are we feed itself ?
or better , how we can help conditions do that every community to enable themselves , to feed ?
the to do , look not on the <unk> for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's done .
capital , chemistry and ever-faster machines are at <unk> and it has never heard something really good for food produced .
we look , the environmental role model .

you look , miguel , farmers how miguel ,
businesses , not worlds for , are , businesses , where instead <unk> , businesses , the <unk> grow , rather than just hard to farmers , not just <unk> are , but experts , relationships ,
because they are the ones who also in , for the flavor .
and when i really be honest , i 'm sure you 're a better at us as i do it ever be going .
so you know that 's me , right , because if that the future of good food is , they are delicious .
thank you .
if i do you today , one thing with want it 's the set of the data that we consume , greater is as the sum of bits and instead of it , <unk> to think i want to you think about how we information that can use that , well let me up and that we actually realize that otherwise would n't have been visible .
so , what we see here 's a typical <unk> , age of these .
this program that i here is , is a little experiment .
it 's <unk> and what i do with <unk> can do this is that i after a certain death filter it , we say , accidents .
and instantly i see a different patterns that , it .
and that , because in <unk> here in the people at the <unk> are and they over here at the <unk> .
we can one step further out and make the data and new , and see that <unk> and cancer , the usual suspects , are , but not for everyone .
if we now go and after the age of the number , we say , 40 years or a younger , we see that accidents , even the cause is about the , the people are going to start thinking .
and who <unk> see that is especially in men 's true .
you see so that look of information and data in this way , to swim in a living <unk> reminds us .
and if we do this for raw data can do why not , the content in itself ?
what we now have here are the covers , every single , `` the sport <unk> '' that ever actually been .
it 's all over here . it 's everything online .
you can it would like , my talk in their rooms and test .
with <unk> can you to pull in a decade .
you can just in a particular year .
you could directly to of a copy one .
now if i here at night , i see the athletes , in that the appear and the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so i click , here for what we have to me all , to show in which have lance armstrong and i will .
now , when i just a <unk> so people get to , i could think , `` ok , what if i mean anything with the subject of walking , i look ? ''
so i a step back and <unk> the way .
now i greg <unk> .
and so you get an example of that if you this information on , specifically , , much more <unk> , <unk> , for you do n't or <unk> not just .
you do something that actually a little differently .
it 's something between , and we think it 's changing the way , and the way as information can be .
i want this idea now a little out on with about what a little crazy .
what here we 've done is , we have any of <unk> and they 're going on a little summary of boils down .
the summary of a short , often , and a symbol of the area of them coming .
i 'm just , the top , in the popular <unk> .
but even in this <unk> view , we can a lot of things do .
immediately , we have a sense of the issues , on wikipedia , the popular .
so i 'm the issue <unk> '' vote .
now , after i <unk> ' one of have you know what i see , <unk> , the most people , so , `` time magazine , `` people the year , '' .
this is really important , there is an insight is that 's not in a single <unk> is .
this is just to see if you a step back and the entire at .
overlooking on a certain kind of <unk> i can then in the theme of time magazine , `` people the year , '' in to go , and all together .
now if i say these people consider you know what i that the majority of <unk> . some people come from the science . some , less , come from the economy . it 's my head . and one comes from the <unk> .
and interestingly , is a bono 's also a ted prize winner .
so we can now to jump , and a view on all the ted prize winner .
you see , we 're surfing on the net the first time as if it also really a net is , not only from side to side , but much more abstract .
and so i want you what else to show what a little surprise to be .
i 'll show you here 's just the new york times website .
<unk> , this application -- i want it 's not a browser and it ; it 's not a browser , but you can websites to look -- and we bring these <unk> to every single website , like this .

this is so important , because you just through that look at the web in the kind of the way , all the <unk> on the same way , and the way at it .
so i can in my as we can zoom in a certain time .
here is the entire demonstration , i went to go on .
and i can , everything that i now been considered to have , back .
and , when i went back a step <unk> and on all look , can i mean by the new way , perhaps , my <unk> . here , i , <unk> ' `` for , here , bing , right here to live labs <unk> .
and of this is , i in the side of the inside and they went back up .
it 's a metaphor , and it 's used , and every time , it does this picture than the sum of data .
the moment in the world , we think that 's a curse .
we talk from the curse at the <unk> .
we talk from `` drowning in information . ''
what , if we this situation around you could and the internet on the head to ask , so that we instead , from one to the other to go to start of many things to many things go to , and it creates pattern of see , which is this actually has never be ?
if we do this can , is this record <unk> , maybe a new source more information .
and , instead , just in information to move , we know it to get .
and if we know about , then we can maybe even the wisdom of it .
so i hear on , thank you .
i grew up with a <unk> portion of science fiction .
in my school , i went to the bus to school , every day an hour a way .
and my nose was always in a book , a <unk> , that my mind in other worlds <unk> and on <unk> in my deep in me sitting , voracious curiosity satisfied .
this curiosity that , that i always , when i do n't look at school was , by the forests <unk> , around and `` where '' which collected , frogs and snakes and the beetle , and <unk> , everything , home to paint and the microscope at .
i was totally <unk> , you know .
it was so , the trial , the world to understand and the limits of explore .
and my love to science fiction to , in my picture , since then , in the late '60s , we went to the moon and they were the deep ocean .
jacques cousteau came in our living with his chief ways it shows , animals and places and a world of miracle that showed that we 'd never have can imagine .
that has then , very good to the <unk> <unk> .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and there 's no video games , these <unk> with computer-generated movies , the imagery in the media , i had to the images in my head .
that we had at all . if we as kids a book on the very , we took the description of the author and projected them in the screen in our minds .
my response that was the drawing , and draw from alien , alien worlds , robots , spacecraft , and all so what .

the creativity has to , somehow figure out .
and i was something interesting . what i can find is , jacques <unk> they were intrigued , was the idea of us , unfamiliar world here on our planet itself .
certainly would i mean , never an alien world with a spaceship at reaching . that it struck me very unlikely .
but here was a world , i actually ever been able to here on the earth , and she was also fascinating and exotic as all that , what i always imagined was , when i these books have read it had .
so i decided , when i was 15 , divers .
the only problem that was that i was in a small village in canada , living , one over 12,000 miles away from the ocean from .
it was that i do n't <unk> .
i 've been bugging my father , until he finally one <unk> in <unk> , new york , participants did , right on the other side of the border , where we lived .
i made my <unk> in a pool of <unk> in the winter , in <unk> , new york .
the ocean , but , a real , the ocean , i was just two years later to face , when we , california to flat .
since , in the 40 years , now <unk> are , i spent about three to 10,000 hours of spent . 500 million hours of them in <unk> .
and i learned that the world of the deep , even in the <unk> oceans , so rich , <unk> life is , how we really hardly anyone can imagine .
the realm of nature 's no borders , in as opposed to our own , <unk> human imagination .
to the end of days i feel that i then the awe , that , what i on my <unk> see .
and my love to the ocean is , with the same intensity as they said , and ever .
when i then as adults , a profession <unk> , it was that <unk> .
that seemed the best way , my inner drive , stories to share with my desire , images to create , to unite .
as a child would i always on the comic books and so .
so , movies , the way , images and stories <unk> . that fit together .
of course , was the stories that i <unk> , from the science fiction , `` the terminator , '' `` aliens , '' and `` <unk> . ''
in `` <unk> '' i was my preference for the <unk> and that come with the <unk> connect .
so the case , of my two passions .
something interesting happened , `` <unk> '' : to a <unk> problem in this film to solve -- and that we had this sort of liquid <unk> create -- , <unk> we on a computer-generated animation , <unk> , back .
what do that came out , was the computer-generated <unk> , ever in a film to see .
the movie . and it 's no money , just told them was he just over time , by a , but i found a fascinating , the audience around the world was like <unk> the magic , it was writing .
according to arthur clarke 's law . you know , <unk> technology and magic does n't even more have evolved to tell .
they saw so something magic .
and that i found it 's incredibly exciting .
and i thought , `` wow , this must have in the <unk> be involved . ''
so we went in `` the terminator , two , '' my next movie , much more .
and with <unk> created we there , the guy of liquid metal . the success were , , like this effect to be .
and it worked . again , we had something magic . and the effect in the audience was the same . however , we have to the movie , a little bit more money <unk> .
of these experiences from , was a very new world , a very new world of creativity , <unk> .
so i was a company , along with my good friend <unk> winston studio , the to speak at the best <unk> and <unk> . they called `` the digital <unk> . ''

that we did , and wildlife that a while a comparative advantage .
but the '90s , we realized we , we in <unk> and <unk> -- what we the company , actually started had -- to slow <unk> .
i had this piece `` the avatar . '' written , that the <unk> in terms of visual effects and <unk> effects , new heights , it should , realistic human , expressive characters , using <unk> there were . and the <unk> should all <unk> be . and the world to <unk> be .
but the <unk> put stuff , and the people in my company that told me that we <unk> still not in the ability to be that to create .
so , shifted , and made this is another movie about the big ship , that goes .
the <unk> i think that as `` romeo and juliet on a ship . '' and sells . it was a <unk> distilled <unk> , a film .
in ways , but i wanted to actually , real partner up at the titanic immerse ourselves .
so i have the movie .
this is the truth . the studio , i knew that , but not .
i put them , but i believe , by i said , `` we come to the cover up . we filming the actual up .
we 're going to it in the <unk> the film us .

and i <unk> you , an expedition to finance .
sounds crazy . but that goes back to that the own imagination a reality do it .
we created the fact , six months later a reality , in the i 'm in russian <unk> end , four kilometers from the surface of the atlantic , and me to the real titanic amount of a <unk> at .
that was no movie , not definition , that was .
so that has really amazes me away .
and the preparation that were enormous . we had cameras and a spotlight , and all sorts of building .
and i fell on the very these <unk> , a <unk> similar .
well , they were also <unk> and <unk> <unk> planning .
you in this time capsule , it you in this dark , hostile environment , down , where no hope , saving is , it does n't even back to do .
and i thought , `` wow , that 's also , as if i 'm in <unk> .
this is really cool . ''
i was it became obsessed by studying the deep ocean .
anyway , of the part , with curiosity and science to do . it was it . it was an adventure , it was curious . it was an imagination .
and it was an experience , made me to do n't give you could .
because , you know , i was able to me a being able to do for that we then a visual effect which could . but i could n't tell me that we can imagine , what i was outside the window would see .
some , the following expeditions i being in <unk> seen , and sometimes these things that i still never seen before i had , sometimes , things that all , nobody ever seen before , and for that science to the time , when we do you saw , actually , no words had found .
that , i was so really transformative , and i wanted more .
and so i then a something unusual thing you .
after the success of `` titanic '' i tell me , `` okay , i want to my <unk> as a filmmaker , in hollywood , ice , and i 'm going for a while <unk> . ''
and we then , we came up to `` <unk> '' , and they were with <unk> .
we returned to cover up the titanic .
we took a little robot that we built , the a <unk> <unk> .
our intention was , <unk> , the inside the ship at , what you 've never did was .
nobody had ever the inside <unk> demands . you 'd still not for another . so we evolved the will technology .
well , and there sitting i mean , on the deck of the titanic , in a <unk> , and i see <unk> , this <unk> 's quite similar , and of which i know that once the band , there was playing .
and i was with a little <unk> through the aisles of the ship .
i so if it 's just really , but my mind is within the cutting-edge technology .
it felt , as if i exercise within the <unk> the titanic , and there .
that was the <unk> form of <unk> , i ever experienced . because before i move forward to a corner on , i 've always been , in the <unk> the cutting-edge that you would , because i for months about <unk> , all that was , when we the film did .
this is set it was , which is an exact replica of the plans , the ship .
so this was a very strange .
they made me this <unk> that what you have such <unk> avatars are using and so that own consciousness in the vehicle , in these different form of existence where there .
it was incredibly profound
and may also a small view on this , maybe in a few decades could happen , if you <unk> has to something to explore , or other things to do , in all sorts of <unk> <unk> , i told me as <unk> can imagine .
after this expeditions we started this , what we get down there had seen , really appreciate to learn , for those <unk> , where we these amazing how they saw . that are sort of the aliens , but here on earth .
they live , chemosynthesis .
they 're not in a on the sunlight , but the system , how we do that .
and so you see animals , the next to a 500 different degrees say that , they survive .
the same time so i also very much for <unk> , that was again , the <unk> from my childhood .

that was fascinating .
but the end , it was on beyond that i <unk> with us in the deep took .
i took them , and <unk> you access to the world down there , <unk> , <unk> , people , for such extreme conditions were . i took them to the sources , so , you look around , so , and instruments , see what we could and so forth .
we turned on a documentary , run , but actually science , more specifically , <unk> .
so effectively lock , the circle anywhere between my existence as <unk> , at a kid , and of those in the reality .
in over these as i have a lot learned .
i have a lot of science learned . but now i think they certainly , a director to also can lead , a leader , like a <unk> or so .
i understood , but not a lot of leadership , before i do this ocean expeditions <unk> .
because of a certain point i had to tell me , `` what i do is actually here ?
why i do that ? what comes out of it ? ''
these stinking films to bring us no money .
we play time now , by a . of fame , not a lane .
all think , i was between , `` titanic '' and `` the avatar . '' <unk> and i 'd made me some of nails it on a towel on the <unk> .
i 've all these films , these documentary , for a very small audience .
not a fame , not honor , no money . what are you just ?
you 're doing it to the task will to the challenge for -- and the ocean is the <unk> environment , there 's . you 're doing it the <unk> because , and because of funny connection , which is , if a small group of people a team is .
because we have all this with only 10 to 12 people did , many years , 24/7 working . sometimes we were to two , three months in the lake .
and in this community makes you that the most important thing that will be aware is that you , each other , because you a task does , that you any one can explain .
if you to land back , says , `` we had to do it , this fiberglass , the <unk> , and that , around the whole technology , and the trouble , the human <unk> , if you on sea to work , '' , you can this other just do n't explain . this is the police or in the soldiers , something together we have gone through and you know that they do it never met anyone can explain .
there is a connection , each other respect .
when i so back to my next film `` the avatar . '' to turn , i tried to the same <unk> to run , which is that you could be a respected , in return to respect , deserves .
it was the dynamics really changed .
because i was so again with a small team on the unknown terrain . we did that , `` the avatar . '' with a new technique that it before , not there .
it 's incredibly exciting .
an enormous challenge .
and we were for a period of four years to , family .
it changed , my way , films to do , completely .
it was giving people that said , we have these <unk> yes , really good <unk> and the planet pandora 's used to go .
for me it was more a <unk> way , my job to do , the actual process , in the result has changed .
what we can so from all of close ?
the lessons we 've learned ?
i think , at the first place is the curiosity .
it 's the most human property .
our imagination is a force , even a reality do it .
and the aware of your team is more than all <unk> this world .
come to me boy , filmmaker , say , they give me one of advice , like that can do . ''
and i say , `` <unk> you do n't even a .
that they put it 's another for you . do n't it to myself , i 'll do n't pretend to themselves . but to take risks , you . ''
the nasa has been so a <unk> , `` no matter is not an alternative . ''
but in the art and the study to fail , an alternative , because there will it 's a leap .
no big endeavor , that innovation for at that was ever , without risk of being addressed .
you must be ready , these risks on , .
that 's the idea , i like to do with the want to leave . failure is quite an alternative , fear but it 's no . thanks .
today i 'm going to you about energy and climate .
and that i 've just maybe something that , because my <unk> in the foundation of the vaccines , and seed is about the things that we reinvent ourselves , and they have to the poorest two billion a better life to get there .
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , in fact , even more than for each other on the planet .
<unk> means that their <unk> over many years to do n't grow up . it we 're going to a lot sooner or to get out of rain . the things are , that change , it 's on their fragile environment is not withstand more you .
and that <unk> . it leads to the uncertainty . it leads to riots .
so , is a climate change , terrible for them .
and it 's the <unk> for you very important .
the fact is that , if you just from one , the price down could , to <unk> would energy , anywhere near the most effective .
now , the <unk> is about the time , like .
actually based on the <unk> on <unk> .
the <unk> towards the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century . there 's a <unk> case in <unk> and why we 've refrigerators , <unk> , we can fully modern materials to make and so many things do .
we are so in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , if we the price down -- we let us the price in case -- we meet in a new green barrier , and this barrier on with carbon .
co2 up the planet and the equation for carbon is actually pretty clear .
they <unk> that <unk> co2 , which to <unk> is , and these <unk> has some very negative . effects on the weather and maybe even worse , the indirect a consequence that the natural ecosystems , such <unk> changes not to shift can and so the whole systems to come together .
now , the exact correlation between a <unk> and the frame of net <unk> and where the more important consequences are , there 's some <unk> , but not very many .
and there 's safe <unk> about how to get those consequences will . but they are extremely they ca n't be .
i have the <unk> times , and asked , `` we need to really down to close to come ?
does n't the half or a quarter ? ''
the answer is , until we 're near zero to come to the temperature on up .
so it 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than to say , we have a three feet high levels of the heat under a number 3 feet a bridge from . the then you can basically , and down .
this must , after the bottom , zero .

every american about 20 tons . people of the poor countries , less than one .
the average are 's about five million tons for each one on the planet .
and somehow we need to change that it on going down .
it 's far as up .
just a bunch of economic transformations to have it 's actually affects and we need to of <unk> in order to reduction , and to a reduction , zero .
this equation , four factors . a little <unk> . you have this thing left -- and co2 -- that they 're moving towards zero to break , and this is from the number of people depend , the service , every person in the average use , the average of energy for every service and the co2 , that 's energy <unk> will .
you make us so every single factor of them and look carefully , we , how we this in zero .
likely to one of these numbers very close to zero .
now this is the basic algebra , but we take it , through .
so we have the population .
today life was 6.8 billion people ,
and it is happening on 9 billion to . the , nine billion to move .
if we 're very successful with new vaccines , the <unk> and <unk> are we could this as well , to 10 percent to 15 percent mortality down , but at the time we see a slope to 1.3 .
the second element of these are the services , we use .
that includes all the food , we eat , clothing , television , heating .
that are very good things and <unk> mean , those services , almost every working on the planet accessible to .
it 's amazing that number drops .
in the rich world , in the upper half billion , we could probably <unk> do and less use , but the average is that number of every year go up , so collectively than double , as well , services , per person by the whole .
here we see a very basic services . there 's going to home light , so you the homework can read it ?
and these students have n't it , so they go out and reading your <unk> under the <unk> .
now , in efficiency , the e , the energy per service , there 's finally got news .
we have something that 's not going up ,
because of success in <unk> , each other <unk> , through new ways in <unk> , there 's a lot of services , their energy , some of those services , let , to 90 percent to happen .
in other service of the manufacture of <unk> , 105 <unk> -- <unk> <unk> or the <unk> or <unk> the scope for improvement , very much smaller .
in general , if we make these are , we might be a reduction , to a factor , three or maybe even to a factor of six .
but in the first three factors , we 're now of 26 billion , maybe <unk> 13 billion tons of gone . and that just not from .
we look so the fourth factor of -- and this is a x-factor be -- this is the amount of co2 , a couple of energy <unk> will .
it turns , the question , if you this in zero can get .
if you coal , burning , no .
if you gas will burn , no .
almost every <unk> for electricity <unk> now , the co2 , except that renewables , and my rocketry that .
so , what we were on a global level to do , is , a new paradigm to create .
we need <unk> .
now if i the term `` wonders , '' i use , i 'm not the impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer is a miracle .
the internet and of services is a miracle .
the people here have to the development of miracle that contributed .
normally , there 's not a deadline , that you a miracle to a date , needs .
normally what you basically just wrong and some people come to do n't .
in this case , we must , but the floor , and give a miracle in very short time .
now , i wondered , how to really <unk> ?
there 's a natural place , a demonstration of the idea of people here with ?
i think back to the last year , when i mosquitos to somehow , liked the people that .
the idea was for you actually intangible , you know that , people there , with these life .
for energy , i noticed that 's a .
i decided that <unk> of fireflies , my <unk> contribution to the environment that would be here .
so here are a couple of natural fireflies .
this , me that you to do n't bite . in fact , they will probably wo n't time that glass of .
now , there 's all kinds of <unk> like this , but they bring all not much .
we need a solution , either one or of the an incredible scale and how incredible <unk> . and although it many ways , there , in which people do , we find yourself , i really just five , these big needs can afford .
i tides , <unk> , the merger and better biofuels out .
this afford to be a ; contributions and if you better to do when i expect , that would be great , but i mean the core here is that we of all those five to work , and we ca n't of you give up , because they have to imagine , because all have significant problems .
we look at the burning fossil fuels , burning of either of coal or gas .
what you there are going to , it may simply , but that 's not . you have to all the co2 , that after the burning of clockwork comes to capture , under pressure <unk> and then , somewhere between them and hope that , there 's left .
there 's some well , it on a 60 percent -- 80 percent level of creating , but it on 100 percent to get it 's very difficult to be . and a way for the storage of co2 to achieve that 's a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the <unk> .
who would have to make sure ?
who can do something you need to literally hours a billion times bigger than any type of garbage , the , of <unk> and other things we can imagine ?
this is a lot of volume .

the next thing : my rocketry that .
the also has three big problems . the cost , in <unk> countries are high . the question after security , that you really feel that nothing wrong can go , despite the human organization that the fuel not for weapons , it 's used .
and what do you then with the garbage ?
because even though he 's not very large is , there 's lots of concerns .
so three very difficult problems that may even though they are , and , which you that work should .
the last three of five , i 've summarized .
it are those renewables , often be called .
and also the have -- although it is that they do n't make fuel needs to -- they have some downsides .
one thing , is the <unk> , these technologies create dramatic lower than the of <unk> .
that are <unk> , you talk about of you <unk> , times more land area as a normal power .

the sun does n't seem to the whole day , they seem , not every day and it blows , the wind and not the time .
so you have to , you kind of these various sources , which is , a way to have to the energy , in times when they do is available to get .
there 's so large <unk> . there 's the challenges in the transmission . if we for example , say that the power of the country is , you do n't just the technology , you must also with the risk around the energy from where different from .
and there 's the <unk> .
and the way to show , i 've all kinds of the batteries , there are , at , the work for cars , computers , phones , <unk> , for everything . and that i did with the amount of an electrical energy , which the world is , compared . i found out that all the batteries , we now producing , less than 10 minutes of <unk> them , you could .
we need so here 's a breakthrough , something that to a factor of 100 times better be going to the approaches to the time .
this is not impossible , but it 's not that .
that happens , you 're trying to these <unk> sources of we say , 20 percent -- 30 percent of the is to earth .
if you to 100 percent to sustain want to do you need an amazing with was .
now , where we going to go , what 's the right approach ?
a `` manhattan project , '' ? how we get the goal ?
what we need are many companies that it work . hundreds of .
in every one of five different areas we need at least 100 people .
in many you will say , that are nuts . that 's good .
i think , here in the ted group there 's many , there 's been engaged .
bill that has several different companies , under the other one named <unk> the great <unk> .
<unk> <unk> invested in dozens of companies , the great things do and interesting ways , and i try this to support .
nathan myhrvold and i pay for a company that , may surprise , the nuclear approach to follow .
there 's some innovations in <unk> ; this modular , liquid .
the development has in this industry , some time i stopped , so it 's no big surprise that some good , lying .
that <unk> means that you instead of a part of the <unk> , the one percent , that <unk> , we decided that 99 percent and burn , that <unk> .
this is quite a crazy idea .
but actually did you about it 's a long time thinking , but you could never as to simulate , whether it would work , but since it in a supercomputer that there , you 're and see that : aye . with the right <unk> , it looks like this from that it <unk> .
and because you that 99 percent of burning , is that <unk> very much better .
actually burning , the garbage , and you can even the waste of any kind of them as <unk> use .
instead , about the head to break , burn them , it . one thing .
this highly enriched uranium dioxide is too uses , a little bit like a candle .
you see that 's a way that pillar is , often than `` a traveling wave of reactor '' by .
that solve really the <unk> .
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky .
this is the waste , the 99 percent . this , the part , today , you will , <unk> so it <unk> uranium .
the reverse the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and if you <unk> inexpensive and just <unk> , you have fuel for the rest of lifetime of the planet .
you know , there 's still many challenges , but it 's a sample of many hundreds of concepts that we need to move forward to come .
think we , how we do our success to measure to .
how to our own testimony to look like ?
now , we go to the goal , that we have to and then we 're talking about the <unk> .
many speak of giving 80 percent reduction , until 2050 .
it 's actually very important that we 're going to get .
the rest of 20 percent are in the poor countries to be produced , and still something that agriculture . hopefully will <unk> and cement , until then clean .

the other note she says , whether we the <unk> technology , in fact , if you in all the developed countries used is , and we on the way are , you to the rest to get .
that 's important .
this is a key that <unk> .
if we from there back , how to the 2020 as testament to look like ?
it should be back the two elements of them .
we should be the <unk> use to reduce the on the way to earth . the less we <unk> , more low is the <unk> , and so , the temperature .
but actually is this note for the things that we companies that do n't completely to the big , <unk> lead , just right , or even a matter less like the other , which the speed of innovation for this amazing breakthroughs that .
this amazing breakthroughs , we 're working with the floor to track and that we can measure , in <unk> , in <unk> and <unk> .
there 's many great books to this topic .
that al gore 's book `` we have the choice '' and david <unk> `` <unk> energy <unk> the all about the air . ''
you take it really , and create a frame , this wide , discussing can be , because we need to support of all sides .
there 's a few things that come together .
this is a request .
a very specific wish that we do this technology making up .
if they told me just a wish for the next 50 years from now , i could the president to choose , a telephone lasts , and that i love , i could this desire to vote , which is , <unk> <unk> no carbon is being invented . this desire to take , i .
this has the biggest impact .
if we 've got this desire to do n't get there to the dig in between the long and those are people are terrible , between the u.s. and china , between the poor and rich countries . and almost all life of these two billion are very much worse .
what do we do ?
for which means for <unk> i ?
we have to for more the context of those .
if countries , in places like <unk> meet , you should not just about carbon .
they should those <unk> to go and they were shocked by the ridiculous , low money , for this using it approaches one .

we need to spread the message .
we need a conversation was and the entire lead and also the things that the government to be done .
it is a desire , but i think , we can see him meet .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thanks !
thank you . only to <unk> something better to understand -- first , you get us an idea of the scale of investment , there ?
bill gates : the simulation is on a supercomputer to do , all the great scientist to get , what we 've done , we need just some 10 million . and even if we our materials in a russian nuclear reactor tested have to ensure that it as to work , is you only in the <unk> million .
the hard to step is that build the first vessel , another billion to find that <unk> and the place the fact , the first of them .
once the first 's done , when he that 's like i promised , everything is that very , because the sense , the <unk> is so different than in my rocketry passion , how we know them .
the right to understand : that , and deep in the ground to almost like a vertical pillar of a nuclear <unk> , this <unk> <unk> and then starting the process , up and works , on up to the bottom ?
bg : right . now you want to the reactor , to turn into , so there 's many people and lots of control is that go wrong can . this thing where you do it opens and things that influences , or going . that 's not good !
if you , but very cheap fuel , you can tell him for 60 years into -- you think of an essential pillar -- that they bury , without the whole <unk> .
and it 's sitting there , and takes 60 years long and then it 's done .
a nuclear reactor , even a solution for the garbage is .
bg : yeah . so what do with the garbage is happening : you can see him sitting , let 's -- there 's much less than waste , with this method -- then they take him and grab him in the reactor and burn it on .
and we start , by we the garbage , the already exists , in these <unk> or <unk> in the reactors is . this is our <unk> .
so this is , which for these reactors operate a problem was that , what we in our fill and this is that <unk> dramatically reduce that during this process .
but while you with different people that world of opportunities that we 've talked ,
where it 's the interest , so what really to implement ?
bg : well , we 've still not on a place so , and there 's a lot more interesting <unk> for all the `` nuclear '' in the name is . there 's big interest and the people the company was in russia , india , china -- i was here and have the minister , and talking about it , like this to <unk> .
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have something in the direction .
this is a nuance of thing that was taken .
this is a step forward , but it 's like a faster the reactor and some countries have this built , why is everybody , a rapid reactor implemented , a <unk> for our first .
in their idea : the time and the probability that really launched in to shout out ?
bg : well , we need one of <unk> , <unk> things that very affordable these are , we have 20 years to innovate and then 20 years to use .
that 's sort of the deadline , the <unk> demonstrated , that we all need to .
and , you know , <unk> , if all goes , and that 's a desire , that easy .
and fortunately , there 's now , dozens of companies , and we need hundreds of , as well , when their new approaches to work , the funding for your pilots to work , for <unk> can .
and it would be the , if they are creating , since then you could be a mixture .
anyway , we need a solution .
what the large variety of major breakthroughs , this is the biggest , that you know ?
bg : a <unk> like this is announcing .
that would it , without the <unk> been , but that makes it 's still so much more .
in a nuclear sector , there 's another , innovative companies .
you know , we know the work not as well , like this , but there 's the up way that 's a different approach .
there 's a fluid <unk> , which is something hard to , say the one of us .
and there 's different , but the beauty of it 's , <unk> a million times as much energy , like a , we say , a <unk> and so , if you with the problems can deal , and that are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , plays the potential , so the impact on the country and other things , almost ran in your league table .
if that does n't , what ?
we need to <unk> need to try to the <unk> stable enough to do ?
bg : if you in this situation , it 's as if you to be much eating , and just a heart attack . what do you then ? you might be a <unk> or something .
there 's a <unk> the , <unk> called , with various techniques , trying to the warming continues to delay , so we 20 or 30 years longer had to us <unk> .
this is just a <unk> .
you hope , that we do n't need .
some people say , you should n't just kind of the insurance to work , because one that might be lazy , so you to eat , because you know that a the <unk> save it .
i do n't know if that 's smart , is , if you , the importance of this problem of eyes that , but there 's now a larger discourse in <unk> about , if you that 's available to have to , if the things faster come , this innovation longer need , when we expect .
climate change , you have a or two sentences for the to you might want to convince them ?
bg : well , unfortunately , in the skeptics in very different kinds of bully .
the ones who , are doing , are very little bit .
they say that 's negative effects , there , with the clouds to have to the things here ?
there 's very , very few things that they do need to ask of it 's an opportunity in a million there .
that <unk> here 's like with aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for very much later .
and why is the idea , now , if you all kinds of compiled them , in something to invest in that you only later , which has -- and there 's the investment , not that 's clear . actually is the ipcc report did n't necessarily the worst case scenario and there 's people in the rich world , climate through and say , okay , that 's no big drama .
the fact is that uncertainty of us are going to do .
but my dream is that , it , economic can do , and at the carbon over , say , the skeptics , `` okay , it i 'm not that 's no carbon <unk> , i wish i almost that it did that , but i 'm it has to accept , because it 's cheaper than the previous one way . ''
and that would be your answer on the <unk> <unk> argument that , if you all this time and energy use the co2 problem to solve , all the other goals , suffering , the <unk> that we face of malaria and so that 's a stupid waste of resources , is , money to invest , while it better stuff there , we can do .
bg : well , and actually spending for the research -- we say the u.s. to 10 billion per year , spend when they do today -- that 's not so dramatically .
it should be other things not suffer .
you then it comes to big <unk> , and here to bring sensible people on , if you something , that 's not economic growth is , and trying to the to finance . for me is going on the most of waste .
it was because , you is very quickly with a <unk> and they were only still the curve . i think we should be more things are trying to the potential to have , very much cheaper .
if the <unk> , you get , a very high <unk> is , you can only the rich up .
i mean , each of us here i could take five times as much for our energy on without his lifestyle to change .
for the bottom two billion , but it 's a disaster .
and even <unk> think anybody .
his new <unk> is now , `` why is the research do n't even more than one ? ''
he 's still , because of his earlier stories , <unk> associated , but he has understood that a very rare group is , and so it 's now that <unk> .
and that 's a <unk> , i for them to think .
the research , it 's just nuts , how little , which is .
bill , i think i speak for almost all people here , when i say , i really hope that you wish that 's going . you , thank you .
bg : thanks .
some years ago , here at ted , and peter <unk> a <unk> called `` the <unk> '' ago .
the idea is quite simple . <unk> to the biggest <unk> structure with 20 <unk> , about . <unk> tape , about . <unk> ourselves and a marshmallow , building .
the marshmallow to on top .
and , though it really just seems , it 's actually really , because it people being very quickly work together .
and so i thought that it 's an interesting idea is that i and it in a <unk> into .
it was a huge success .
since i spent about 70 workshops world 's done , with students , developers and architects , even with <unk> the <unk> and there 's something , this task , which at some insights in the nature of cooperation across the technologies and i want some of them to share with you .
usually on the most people , in the task to orient .
you talk about , you to look like it will look , they <unk> to go ,
then on them a little time in planning and organization . they 're drawing and put <unk> .
they invest in a lot of their time in the to build the time <unk> structures
and finally , just before they were no time , have to take someone the marshmallow and they put him gently down on the top , just a step back and `` <unk> . '' admire them their work .
what but then , almost always , what happens is that `` <unk> '' to a `` <unk> '' is , because the marshmallow is causing the whole thing , how you and <unk> .
there 's a series of people that much more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have to other , and the worst enemies are totally fresh <unk> .
they 're lying , they cheat , they are confused and make really <unk> shapes .
and of course , there 's also on the more , `` <unk> '' <unk> have and the best are totally fresh alumni of kindergarten .
and this is quite astonishing .
like us , peter ward was to make you 're not just the highest towers , but also the most interesting structures of all .
what you might ask , is : how is that ? why ? what about that ?
and peter 's telling : `` none of kids into this time it was the <unk> <unk> to be . ''
they invest , no time in <unk> .
but there 's still one more reason .
and that that mba students get trained by the a real plan to find , ok !
and it and then to realize .
now what happens when you the marshmallow for the top of profanity , they have no time , and what ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar , what ?
what <unk> do differently , is that they do with the marshmallow start and prototypes to build a successful prototypes , with the marshmallow , the top , so that you can see the opportunity to have <unk> prototypes to fix .
<unk> recognize this kind of the collaboration as a core of <unk> are about .
and with every attempt to get the kids right across the feedback , what works and what do n't .
this is the performance , prototypes to work , much -- but we see again , how other teams operate .
the average for the most is at about . <unk> that mba students to create a half of that , lawyers do something more , but not much , <unk> are better than the adults .
who is the most successful ?
architects and engineers , fortunately , .
<unk> is the , what i 've seen .
and why ? because they are triangles , understanding and <unk> geometric patterns are the key to stable structures to build .
who are something about the average . but here 's interesting .
of you a that we 've administrator at the team , you going to dramatically better .
it 's unbelievable . you see , to and see , `` this team will win . ''
you can the predictions . why does it ?
because they particular skills of <unk> .
they run the process , they understand him .
and that team that <unk> and on the work to pay attention is the performance of the team dramatically improving .
<unk> skills and <unk> and the combination of lead to succeed .
if you 10 teams have to the typical 're going to get you ca . six , stable structures .
i tried to ask , something very fascinating .
i thought , we bring the <unk> same .
so she offered i a $ 10,000 dollars a price of software for the winner .
what you think happened with these <unk> ?
what was the outcome ?
this happened . not a team had a robust structure .
if someone 's a <unk> high , which is built have , he have the price , home by .
so it 's not interesting is that high <unk> a powerful impact of ?
we repeated this exercise with the students .
what you think happened now ?
well understood you the advantage of the `` <unk> . ''
so , from the same , for team of the best .
they produced the highest construction in the least of time .
there 's so <unk> lessons for us , over the nature of the incentive and success .
you might ask : why would anyone in fact , invest in a <unk> to create ?
the reason is , i 'll help digital tools and processes to make them to teams to help , cars , video and `` <unk> <unk> '' to make it .
and what the <unk> does is to help them hidden assumptions to identify .
because , frankly , each project has its own marshmallow .
the challenge is a shared experience , a common language and you . ethos , the right prototype to build .
and this is the value of experience , this is so easy to practice .
and those of them , it 's interested , can <unk> visit .
it 's a blog , where you see how to the marshmallow .
there 's a <unk> there .
they find a crazy examples from all the world , how people , the system to optimize and <unk> .
there 's also <unk> .
and the <unk> lesson , i think is that structure actually a <unk> sports .
it demands that we all our senses , on the task to and that we think that can use , how our feelings and we do , in the challenge , the front of us .
and sometimes is a small prototype this experience anything , what it needs to us , `` <unk> '' -- to a `` <unk> '' moment to earth .
and that can a big difference .
thank you .
we do so when we have this one machine ,
a big machine , a cool , <unk> machine , and that 's a machine .
and everybody in this room to skeletal muscle .
and you can in the past , go , you can in the future go ; they can not in here , and remain ,
and i wonder , what they vote would , because i my friends in a lot lately asked this question of have , and they wanted everybody in the past .
i do n't know . they were interested in the time , before it cars , or twitter or `` america for the american idol '' .
i do n't know .
i 'm convinced that you kind of nostalgia , to thinking drawn is .
and that i do .
i 'm not part of the group , i must say .
i do n't want to the past , and that 's not , because i was a explorers i 'm --
it 's because that are on this planet does n't go back , you go forward .
so i want in this machine , and i want to the future .
this is the greatest time , it ever attempted on this planet , whatever , which the scale , which is : health , kind of mobility , the opportunities , declining <unk> .
there 's ever been a time , like this .
my <unk> died , when they had 60 were .
my grandparents who this number on 70 .
my parents are the 80 , into iraq .
there should so much better a nine o'clock at my <unk> .
but it 's not time to people like us , because this is a lot more thing than that .
a kid , that today in delhi , born , it can expect , so long to live as the richest man on the 100 years ago .
you think this question . that 's an amazing fact .
and why is that ?
the smallpox . the smallpox would have a billion people on this planet killed .
they have the demographics of earth in a way to be shaped , how it 's no war , ever done .
they 're way . they 're gone .
we have you <unk> . pfft .
in the rich world are diseases , the millions of us , just one generation , threatened to have to do n't yet .
<unk> , <unk> , polio --
i know all , somebody , which is ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability , billion people to feed , that are the successes the scientific method .
and my view , is the scientific method , things out , look , if it works , it change , if it does n't that does , one of the greatest achievements of humanity .
so this is the good news .
unfortunately is , the good news , because there 's a few other problems , and they were often talking about ,
and one of this is that despite all our greatest achievements a billion people in the world every day when to go down .
this number drops , and they are rising very quickly , and that 's embarrassing .
and that , we have our imagination used to , this world that we had to your choice .
drinking water , <unk> country , the rainforests , oil , gas , they disappear , soon , and if we 're not because of chaos <unk> myself , we also .
the question is so , we can do that ? i think it .
i think it 's clear that we food can produce , the billion people are going , without the country , they live , to rape her .
i think , we can this world with energy to bring that they do n't look at destroyed .
i think that really , and no , this is not thinking .
but this is looking at me at night , wake up -- one of the things that me at night awake . we 've been progress , it 's never really needed like now , never ,
and we were also still never in the opportunity to him about <unk> , we do it today can .
we 're going to the threshold to see , amazing events on many places . and yet , i really that we are hundreds of 300 years ago , i go back to have to a time to find , in the we progress , so there have , in the way we think about these things <unk> <unk> have to with more found myself as now .
the people putting , in their faith , so closely , that you have n't release .
not , the truth will you free .
and they stop , everybody has a right on my opinion , ; even a right on my opinion , to ,
but you know , what they 're not quite have ?
they have no right on their own . <unk> , you have n't .
and i have a while it took the three out .
ago about a decade , i have a paper about , vaccination , `` the new yorker , '' written , a little paper .
and i was amazed at the resistance to run into the resistance to the , what the end of the most effective activity in health in history of humanity .
i did n't know , what i should do , so i did just what i always do , i wrote a paper , on .
and soon after that i wrote a paper about <unk> changed the food .
the same thing , only bigger .
the people were crazy .
so i also about one articles written , and i could n't understand why the people thought that would `` <unk> '' , why they believed that molecules on a certain kind of a random jumble of move a <unk> on the area of nature .
but you know , i do what i do . i wrote the articles , i did on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist ,
we type , we 're rich , we go food , that 's okay .
but these articles were told me about , and i could n't figure out , why , and finally , i found it turns out .
and this is that these <unk> , made me nuts were doing it does n't <unk> were .
that were <unk> people , educated people , decent people .
they were just like the people in this room .
and that got me so what i ...
but then i thought , you know what , we 're honest .
we 're in one point where , the we 're not just the same relationship to the progress , how early .
we 're talking <unk> of them .
we 're talking ironic that , with a little quotes about : `` the progress . ''
okay , that there 's reasons , and i think we know , which one is .
we have this faith in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in the science , lost , and there 's no reason , why that 's not that was .
you can just a couple of names we call , and the people to understand .
chernobyl , <unk> , the <unk> , <unk> , of mass , the <unk> 2000 .
i mean , you know , you can your list your vote .
there 's ask , and problems with the people , of which we believed that they always right have . be so they are skeptical .
so you ask , for you evidence that urge you some evidence .
they take nothing more than any given to myself .
but now here 's : if you evidence to get you want to this evidence to assume , and in that we 're not good .
and i can that 's from the reason to say that we now in an epidemic of fear for life , i they still never seen have and hopefully will never see again , let me .
ago about 12 years was a story posted , a terrible story that the <unk> with the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> vaccine appeared in the connection to .
very scary .
lots of studies have been done to see if that 's true .
lots of studies we should be done ; that 's a serious .
the data came in .
the data came in , from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all right , no significant correlation , no link , not .
it makes no difference . it 's no difference , because we of anecdotes that we think , we think , what we see , what we 're going to see to believe what does that we really feel .
we do n't think of a bunch of documents from a <unk> , of us data , there , and i do that , i think that do we all .
but you know what ?
the outcome of it was a catastrophic ,
catastrophic , because of the fact , the u.s. is one of the only countries in the world , the immunization , <unk> down .
that 's absolutely scandalous and we should be ashamed .
it 's awful .
what happened , that we could do .
now , i understand that . that i 'm doing .
because it has anybody here <unk> ?
okay , one in the audience ever get one of <unk> to see ?
it 's not many times .
what happens in this country do n't actually , but the 160,000 time in the world in the last year .
that are many deaths , <unk> , 20 per hour .
but because that 's not happening here is , we make this out , and people like jenny mccarthy , we can walk around and the messages of fear and illiteracy , platforms like the oprah and larry king live preach it .
and that you can do , because they cause and correlation should not connecting .
they do n't understand that these things does seem to be , but almost never the same thing .
and that 's something that we need to learn , very quickly .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk institute .
it liberated us of the worst <unk> of humanity .
not afraid , no moons , polio , up , gone .
the guy in the not so much .
he is paul <unk> .
he has just with a few other people a <unk> .
he can the life of <unk> , a million children per year in the developing to save .
pretty well , not ?
so , that 's good , 's kind of that paul and as of vaccines , talks , and says , how valuable they are , and that people just stop to try to complain .
and that says he actually this .
paul 's a terrorist .
if paul in a public <unk> talks , he ca n't without being armed on one of behavior .
he gets calls home , because the people he 'd like to tell you know where his children to school .
and why ? because paul wrote a vaccine against has done .
i need this is n't say , but vaccines are essential .
you take you continues to return to the disease , terrible disease , and that 's happening now .
we have in this country now <unk> .
and this is worse , and pretty soon be children back of it was dying , because that 's just a question of numbers .
and they 're not just to <unk> die .
what about polio this ? we take that . why not ?
a <unk> of me has to me a few weeks , writing and told you think i 'm a little to <unk> .
nobody has that ever said before .
they would their kid 's not against polio do . on is no .
subtle .
why ? because we could n't see polio this . and you know what ?
we had in this country , no polio virus .
now , i do n't know , maybe she now this morning , someone in lagos , a plane and the right now , we go to los angeles , the moment he is of ohio .
and in a few hours , goes , he and <unk> a car , and he comes after a long beach , and he 's one of <unk> <unk> tonight is gone .
and he does n't know that it with a stock disease , and there is , and we know that 's not , because that 's the world .
this is the planet , we live . they do n't so , as if it do n't .
we love it , us in a lie to membrane . we love that .
you have today morning everybody their supply vitamins , ?
<unk> , a little <unk> , that you on the thing you can help .
i know , that you 've done , because half the americans , that every day .
you take this stuff , and they take an alternative to cure , and it 's no difference , how often we find out that they 're useless .
the data will give the time .
they them up their urine . do more they almost never .
that 's okay , they want to be in 28 billion dollars to the dark , urine numbers .
i agree with them completely .
a dark , urine . dark .
why we doing this ? why we doing this ?
now , i think , i understand -- we hate the industry .
we hate each one to a strong government . we have n't trust the system .
and that we should also not . our healthcare system is miserable .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
it 's absolutely amazing cold and <unk> ourselves to us , it can afford .
we 're so that way , and where we walk , we ?
we walk in the poor the <unk> .
that 's great . i love the <unk> .
but you know , that 's really a serious , because this stuff is crap , and we give a billion dollars for me .
and i 've all kinds of small , some here .
this does n't it -- <unk> , it was , <unk> , it was , <unk> , because i 'm not time , what this is , but we give a billion dollars for , it was .
and you know what ? when i think that i say , shouting at me the people , and say , `` what does it you ? let the people , do , what they want .
so you feel . ''
and you know what ? they 're wrong .
it because i do is , whether it 's the minister is , says , `` hmm , i 'm going to the evidence of my research , mammography does n't suppose '' or any <unk> , his patients with <unk> treat want .
if you , in that went to think , and magic of evidence and science to replace , get them to a place , to do n't you want to be .
they get to i mean in south africa .
he got there have its people to , because he said that he insisted that red <unk> , <unk> and <unk> much more than any antiretroviral drugs are , of which we know that you the course of aids , so you can .
hundreds <unk> deaths in a country , the worse than any other of this disease <unk> will .
you tell me , please do n't that these things do n't have consequences .
the have you . that they 've always .
now the <unk> epidemic , in the we just are , is this ridiculous , struggle between the <unk> <unk> there , food and the <unk> .
this is a <unk> debate . they have to stop .
it 's a debate about words , this metaphor .
that 's anti-israeli ideology , not science .
everything that we eat , every <unk> , each branch <unk> , everybody 're , from the people changed .
you know , there 's no <unk> in the garden .
there 's no <unk> .
there 's no christmas . we 've all this .
we have it in the last thousand years .
and some of this has worked and some of it 's not .
we 're getting rid of what does n't work .
now we can it more . and of course there risks . but we can do something like vitamin a in rice , do , and this stuff can million people to help , million people , their lives to extend .
that you want to do n't do ?
i must say , that i do n't .
we refuse <unk> changed the food .
why we do that ?
so what i always listening is : to a lot of chemicals , pesticides , hormones , <unk> , we 're not a huge areas with one thing that 's wrong .
we do n't want to companies in the patent .
we do n't want to companies seeds have .
and so you know what my answer on all this is ?
yeah , right . fix that we can .
it 's true , we have a <unk> , but that 's not science .
that has with science and nothing to do .
it 's right , right now , <unk> .
you know that the science is not a company is .
you is no country .
you is not , an idea ; she 's a process .
you is a process , and sometimes work , he and sometimes not , but the idea that we of science , not allow us to , their work to do , because we 're afraid of this is a really dead , and they 're holding millions of people from human flourishing .
you know , in the next 50 years , we going to 70 percent longer growing food to as the moment . 70 percent .
this investment in africa in the last 30 years .
embarrassing . embarrassing .
they need that , and we give you what it 's not .
and why ? <unk> changed the food .
we want people do encourage , this <unk> stuff to eat , like for example <unk> .
<unk> is something that half a billion people eat .
it 's about how a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it 's miserable .
it has n't require nutrients , it has not a protein , and scientists building that all right at a .
and then we could the people that food and would n't think there are .
they would n't starving , and you know what ?
that would you . it would n't <unk> <unk> , but it would you .
and everything that i say to it is : why are we that ?
i mean , we ask : why are we that ?
because we 're not genes <unk> want ?
it 's not about the genes move . it 's not to throw chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our it be on the greater , better food , act of food .
it 's not about the rice <unk> , it 's about , the life to get , and it 's time , to understand what this .
because you know what ?
if we do n't do this , if we so on doing as far do we 're going to a bit guilty , the we , i think , not guilty want to be , high-tech colonialism .
there 's no other description for that , what happened here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's our not worthy , and we need to that really stop .
after this amazing kind of entertainment want you so you might say , you still in this ridiculous machine , and the future go ? ''
anyway , . that i want , .
the moment is what you in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity .
we can this machine on all imagine , what we want .
we can you 're moving , where we they 're moving to , and we are they 're going to move , where we want .
we need to those conversations have , and we need to think , but if we in the machine , up and the future , we will be happy to be that made .
i know that we do it can , and as it me in this is something that the world needs now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i 've come for the <unk> . it might never seem to , a magician interested in that , it was because , you look at it as i , as `` a deception , to a real is , if someone just , enough that anybody believes . ''
with other words , <unk> have in some studies have a measurable effect that , the <unk> , just so , because the person thinks that with her going to be a pharmaceutical or a kind of -- in <unk> , for example , there 's , if the patient , we 're , enough that thinks , a measurable effect of the body , you the <unk> called .
one that you 're going to a real , because somebody 's so the world .
so that we 're also understanding , i want you now a fundamental , very simple trick .
and i 'm going to show you know , he works . this is a trick , the least for the 1950s , in every <unk> for children .
i even have taught him from <unk> <unk> magic of <unk> in the 1970s , learned .
i 'm going to him for them out and it , and explain .
and then i 'm going to explain why i told him , let me .
so , and you see what happens .
that knife , that they 're able to ; my hand , they 're able to .
i 'm going to the knife , just so in my off .
i do you my sleeve , back .
and to ensure that nothing in my sleeve away , or from him out , i 'll just my wrist on right here <unk> .
on this way you can see that , to none of time , you move . as i 'm here <unk> , can not in my sleeve , as it or out .
and the goal of it 's very simple .
i 'm going to my hand up , and hopefully , if everything goes well , is that knife by my bare physical <unk> ago .
it 's sitting in fact that , of its place that i do it shake it , without that knife falls .
nothing goes in my sleeve , or it comes out , no <unk> . and you can all study .
<unk> !
so , that 's a trick , i often a little kids affect , for magic to care , because you can , very much about deception to learn , if you specifically looking , though it 's a very simple <unk> trick is .
probably know many of them in this room that trick .
he works , here .
i think that knife in my hand .
i say that i my wrist <unk> to ensure that nothing in my sleeve away , or out , and that 's a lie .
the reason , why i my wrist <unk> the , in that , the real secret of the illusion is .
in the moment is , where i mean by hand of you <unk> to make them back of see , moves , of hands on here , my <unk> , just from there , where it was , in a position , in the he 'd like this extended .
wonderful trick ?
back there 's got someone , not a childhood had .
so , he , this is here . right .
and when i <unk> , changing the hands on its position .
and now you could talk about , why this point of this is , why you do n't have facial that down here just three fingers to see are , because the mind and the way , he received it comes out of , they 're not one by counting , one , two , three , but you as a group can see .
but that 's now here 's not actually , and then i open , i mean by hand .
of course , it there would have no , but not by the <unk> my body , but by a trick , by my <unk> , now there is .
and when i mean by hand , let me , on the same thing , by i <unk> , going through this movement 's the finger , again <unk> .
i guess these hand away . and there is the knife .
this trick , your friends and i used to demonstrate . thanks .
now , what that with the <unk> to do ?
a year ago , or so , i read a study that i 'm really right away .
i 'm not a doctor or scientists , and so i was that for me an amazing thing .
it , which is what turned out , if you a <unk> in a white or so they provide , in the form of <unk> , like this is just a round , white or so , the one of measurable effect .
but if you the shape , in the you that <unk> people , for instance , in a smaller pill to change , and these blue color and a letter that <unk> , it is actually , measurable more .
and that , no , or pharmaceutical -- it are just <unk> .
but a white or so is not as well as a blue pill .
what ? that made me really crazy .
it was , but that this is still not everything is .
if you capsules take , the people are still more than and every form .
a colored the capsule , in one end of yellow and the red is that 's better than a white capsule .
also the <unk> plays a role .
a pill twice a day is not as well , pills -- and i ca now , not to the exact statistics , remember . i do , i 'm sorry .
the really , but is , ...
... that , the <unk> play a role .
and the form of a role .
and if you the ultimate <unk> have to , you have to the needle to reach .
right ? a syringe with a <unk> -- a few <unk> a <unk> substance , you a patient gets into .
that creates a very powerful image in mind . that 's very much stronger than a white pill .
this chart is really -- i 'm going to you a different time to know if we have a <unk> .
the fact , so this is that the white or so not as well it looks like the blue pill , not as well it looks like a time capsule , not as well it looks like the needle .
and nothing in it has some really have pharmaceutical property . it 's only way we believe it , in us a greater impact on .
i wanted to know that i do this idea for a magic trick could use .
i suspect something that obviously a delusion is , and making it 's really look .
we know , from the study that you to the needle to grab , if it on the thing going to .
this is an 18 inch long <unk> . she 's very , <unk> . and i 'm going , first a little bit to render time .
this is really my meat . it 's not <unk> special <unk> meat .
this is my skin . this is not a special from hollywood .
i 'm now this needle in my skin , stick and through them up , until you to the other side bounce back <unk> .
if you it 's going -- if they easily in <unk> fall -- i did that a few friends , the last night in the hotel the , and some people , i did n't know , and what 's a woman 's almost , he 'd become .
i 'm so , if you very quickly , it 's going , then you looking for the next 30 seconds away . or , you know what , i 'm going to the first <unk> part of back here .
you can it 'll see , you can but also <unk> , if you want .
so , it 's so , right here , where my it starts , the bottom of my <unk> i 'll just a little <unk> do .
i do , i really sorry . makes you go crazy ?
and now just a little bit through my skin and the other side that way back out .
now we 're actually in the same situation that we do the <unk> .
about .
but now , my fingers do n't count , right ?
so , when i do you show you . that 's a , two , three , four , five .
well ,
i know what the people think , if you see that .
they say , `` okay , is not so stupid and <unk> , the skin , just to us a few minutes long to talk . ''
now , then i 'm it to show you .
look like this from ? well .
yes , i know .
and the people back , `` okay . i did n't that 's seen . ''
the people in the <unk> are now in .
you make it was to them from the near us .
this is really my skin . this is not a special from hollywood .
this is my meat , and i can that 's swivel around .
i do , i 'm sorry . if you it 's going , look away , look not to myself .
the people back or the , that later , eventually , on video to see how to say , `` well , this is yes , pretty impressive , but if it 's really would , he would -- and you see here 's a hole and there , if it really , would , it would bleed . ''
okay , , let me a blood for you <unk> .
yes , here is it .
normally would i now the needle out .
i would my arm safe and show you that there 's not the wounds .
but i think , in this on here and with the intention , of being a real to do , i 'm the needle just in there 's , and so from the stage .
we 'll the next few days , a couple of time to face .
i hope that you look forward , already on . thank you .
everybody talks about today about that happiness .
i have some people at the number of books just let that , `` <unk> '' in the title , in the last five years out , and they have to think about 40 , and there 's still much more .
there 's a massive wave of interest of happiness , explorers .
there 's very much <unk> .
everybody would like the people are happier lives .
but despite all of flood of work , there 's several different cognitive fall , it , almost impossible to clear about happiness thinking .
and my talk today is mainly from these cognitive map into action .
this is for reporter , of their own happiness is think , and it is for scientists , the lucky to think that , because it turns out that we just like this is what are like each other .
the first of the meeting is a <unk> , complexity , admitting this .
it turns out , that the word , just not a useful in the word , is , because we do it on to all of use .
i think , there 's a particular meaning , on the we 's going to be , but in the great and all this is something that we give up to be , and we 're going to the complicated , which would have to get on the well-being is .
the second case is one of experience and memory , in basically consists of them between be happy in his life and be happy about to live or happy with his life .
and that are two very different ideas , and they 're both <unk> in the idea of happiness .
and the third is the <unk> , and that 's unfortunate fact that we 're not about a situation that can think , the well-being of all , without its importance to warp .
i mean , this is a cognitive and trap .
there 's simply no way , it right to get .
now i 'd like with an example start from someone , a <unk> had , sort of my lectures , a story , covered . [ unclear ... '' ] , he said , he would have a symphony of , and it was absolutely so music , and , the end in this , there 's a <unk> <unk> sound .
and then put it 's add , really quite emotionally , that has the whole experience was ruined .
but that did n't .
what it did was the memories of the experience .
he had the experience i had .
he had 20 minutes <unk> music had .
you care about it , because it with a memory <unk> was ; the memory was ruined , and the memory was everything that he goes to keep getting had .
what we actually says this is that we about us and over the other people think we could in terms of two types of themselves .
there 's a <unk> itself , that in the present to live and the present us know , is able to the past , back to experience , but in basically just the present .
it 's the <unk> itself , that the doctor <unk> -- you know , if the doctor , asks : `` do now it hurts , when i do you here <unk> ? ''
and then there 's a <unk> itself , and that <unk> itself is that , that <unk> and the story of our lives in one , and it 's <unk> , that the doctor 's been by it 's the question is : `` how do you have , in the last time to feel ? ''
or `` how was their journey , albania ? '' or a similar .
that are two very different entities that <unk> , and that <unk> itself , and the wonderful to confuse this is part of the <unk> of exploring the lucky .
so , that <unk> itself is a storyteller .
and that is really begin with a basic reaction , our memories of -- it begins immediately .
we tell you 're not only stories , when we think that make the stories to tell .
our memory , tells us stories , that is , what we of our experiences , keep to 's a story .
and let them <unk> with an example .
there 's an actual study .
that are real patients , a painful procedure in .
i 'm not the really go . you today is not more painful , but it was painful , as this study the 1990s , and did was .
they were asked , all of 60 seconds about their pain to report .
and here are two patients . that are your records .
and they 're asking : `` who of those who has more suffered ? ''
and that 's a very simple question .
a b , clearly , suffered . his <unk> was no longer , and every minute of pain , the patient is a , had had a b , and more .
but now there 's a different question : `` how very thought that these patients that you suffered ? ''
and here 's a surprise .
and the surprise is that patient is a , a lot <unk> <unk> , <unk> had a patient to b .
the stories <unk> were different , and because a very one big part of the story is , ending note --
and no one of these stories is very <unk> or a great -- but one of them is this shows ...
but one of them is much worse than the other .
and the , the worse is it , where the pain , the end on its peak . it 's a bad history .
where we know that ?
because we all these people after their <unk> ask you have , and as much later , `` how bad was the whole thing in general ? `` well ,
and she was much worse for a , as well , b in the <unk> .
so , that 's a direct conflict between the <unk> , and the <unk> itself .
of view of the <unk> even had to b , clearly a <unk> time .
so what you with the patient is a , you could do , and we 've actually now done experiments , and it 's been done , and it works , you could actually the <unk> of the patient is a to extend by showing you just the hose in it 's no , very , to him up .
that 's going to the patient is suffering , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you that a few minutes for power , does that <unk> themselves from the patient is a bad on this is , and this , does that <unk> themselves from the patient is a lot better on this is , because now , your patient is a , a story about his experience , there .
but what 's being , a story from ?
and this is for the stories that the memory that provides and it 's also for the stories that we invent .
what , a story i think are these cases , great moments , and the end .

so , that <unk> itself alive to live in continuously .
it has moments of the <unk> , after the other .
and they ask : what happens with these moments ?
and the answer is really simple . they 're going to always been lost .
i mean , the most moments of life -- and i do that 's about -- you know , the psychological present the other than about three seconds long . which means , you know that it 's in a life about 600 million of there . in a month there 's about 600,000 , the most of you leave no lane .
the most of these are completely ignored by the <unk> itself .
and yet you get kind of the sense that they are we assume that what during these moments of the <unk> 's our lives .
it 's the limited resource that we use as we 're in the world .
and how we they say they would seem to be important , but that 's not the story that the <unk> even for us to keep .
so we do this <unk> , and that <unk> itself , and they 're really quite different .
the biggest difference between them is the 's interacting with time .
of view of the <unk> itself , if you a vacation . and the second one week , that 's good as the first , is the <unk> 's twice as well , <unk> vacation .
so that 's actually not for the <unk> itself .
for the <unk> itself is a <unk> vacation 's better than the <unk> on , because there is no new memories , which i 'd be .
they have the story does n't changed .
and on that 's time , the critical variable that a <unk> itself is different from a <unk> itself . time has very little difference on this story .
so , that <unk> itself is more , as to remember , and stories to tell .
it 's actually <unk> that uses making it , because if you a patient who have to the , we say , two <unk> in two different kinds of surgeons had , decide , which he would choose to , is the , the votes of the memory , the less bad , is , and this is the surgeon , selected will .
that <unk> itself has no voice in this choice .
actually we choose not between those experiences . we choose between the memories of experiences .
and even if we 're going to the future thinking , we think of our future n't normally when experiences .
we think about our future , as <unk> memories .
but basically , can you look at , you know , as a tyranny of the <unk> itself , and you can , that <unk> even think more than one that kind of the <unk> even <unk> through experience , that <unk> themselves do n't need .
i have the sense that if we 're going to the very often the case is , that means we make a vacation largely sitting in a little bottle of the <unk> itself .
and that 's a little hard to justify , i think .
i mean , very <unk> we of our memories ?
this is one of explanations , for the dominance of the <unk> even gave it .
and when i think about , i think of a vacation , we have a few years in antarctica . 've done , at the best on was , i ever had , and i think quite often it in the relationship to , how often , i other <unk> think .
and i 've probably from my memory of these <unk> journey , i 'd say about 25 minutes long , in the last four years <unk> .
now , when i ever since the folder , you have had to 600 million pictures that i would have another one hour spent .
so , that are three weeks , and that are its peak half hours .
because it seems a disagreement , to do .
now , i like a little extremely , you know , it , how little appetite , i on the <unk> of memories of have , but itself , if you more of doing there 's a real question . why we give memories so much weight in <unk> to the weight , that we these are there ?
so i want you to talk about a thought experiment to think .
imagine , you want their next to ago , you know that the end <unk> all their pictures <unk> , and they get a <unk> drug , so that , nothing to remember .
now , you were the same to vote ?
and if you a different to vote would , there 's a conflict between your two types of ourselves and they 're going to think about , this conflict to decide , and that 's really does not obvious , because if you in terms of time thinking they get an answer . and if you in terms of memories , think you could one another answer .
why we the <unk> choose , we do is a problem , that , we do with a choice between the two types of themselves .
now the two types of ourselves into two words from happiness .
there 's actually two concepts of happiness , we can use , of a itself .
so they can ask : how happy , is that <unk> itself ?
and then they would ask : how happy there are those moments in the <unk> itself ?
and they 're all -- luckily for those moments , is a pretty complicated process .
what are the emotions , the measured it can be ?
and the way , we 're now in a pretty good idea to get from happiness , the <unk> ourselves over the time .
if you after the lucky , the <unk> yourself questions , it 's a very different thing .
this is not about it , as happy one person who lives .
it 's of the great satisfaction or by the person is , if this person about their lives to think .
very different .
everybody , those terms n't really different is the study of happiness -- it up , and i belong to a lot of explorers of well-being , the study of happiness have just blew have on that way .
the distinction between the lucky , the <unk> , and the average happiness the <unk> itself is in recent years people 's been , and now , which you , the individual to measure .
the <unk> organization has a global survey , more than a people ask about been are about that you about her life thinking and about their experiences . and there 's another group effort in the direction .
in recent years , we have so i started , about happiness . the two types of ourselves to learn .
and the main thing that , we , i think , we 've learned is that they really different .
you know , as being someone with his life is , and that teaches you really not a lot about , as happy , he gets to live lives and vice versa .
just to make them a sense of the correlation to do that correlation is about <unk> .
what this is that if you who would meet and you would tell you , oh , his father 's a <unk> , how much would you about its size of knowledge ?
now , it would be something about its size , but there 's much uncertainty .
they have so much uncertainty .
if i tell them that someone be life than eight on a scale from 10 <unk> , you have much uncertainty about , as happy , he 's with his <unk> itself .
the correlation is so low .
we know something about what that does the <unk> .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness , basically means , very pleased to be with people that we like , time to spend with people that we 'd like .
there 's another , pleasure , but that 's dominant .
so if you that happiness , the two types of ourselves to maximize that we want you going to the end very different things to do .
the implication of the , what i 'm here said , to have this is that we 're lucky , really not going to be as a substitute for well-being .
it 's a completely another term .
now , very quickly , a another reason , from that we 're not clear about happiness can think this is that we 're not on the same things into that if we talk about the life thinking and if we actually life .
so if you the simple question to ask , as happy the people in california are you will not the correct answer .
if you ask this question you think that the people in california , happy to be if you , we say , in ohio state in .
and what happens is that if you about that live in california to think , you think of the difference between california , and other places , and that difference is , we say , in climate .
well , it turns out , that climate is not very important for the <unk> itself is , and it 's not even very important for the thoughtful , that decide , as happy people are .
but now , because the thoughtful itself is responsible , you get the end -- some people could the end , california .
and it 's kind of interesting to track , what happens with people that , california , pull in the hope , happier .
now , you <unk> themselves will not happy .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they 're going to think that they have are , because if you think about you will of it , how awful the weather in ohio . and they 're going to feel you to the right decision met .
it 's very difficult , clear about well-being of thinking , and i hope that i have you a sense of that , how hard it 's .
thank you .
thank you . i have a question for them .
thank you .
now , when we had a few weeks on 've mentioned , you to me that 's a pretty interesting result , that from this <unk> poll was .
this is something , what you to participate let you can , because they now a few minutes left of ?
daniel <unk> : sure .
i think , the most result , that we have the <unk> survey found have is a number , we absolutely not to expect .
we found that in terms of happiness . the <unk> itself .
if we were watching the emotions with the income <unk> .
and it turns out , that under a minimum income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and that 's a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a big a representative sample , under a minimum income of 600,000 dollars ,
60,000 years .
dk : look .
60,000 dollars , are the people making , and they are increasingly less and the poorer , they are .
that we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean , i 've ever so flat lines .
and what happens is obvious that money , no <unk> you , but that the lack of money , certainly do you , and we can that we do very , right rate .
in the other , the <unk> itself , you get a different story .
ever more money you deserve more and helped me is you .
this is not for emotion .
but danny , in the entire american now it 's going to live , freedom , the quest for happiness .
when people that finding take seriously , would , i mean , it all the head to say , everything that we think , for instance , in terms of policy and so forth .
there 's a chance that politicians that the country , generally , finding out how to take seriously , would and that 's based on to make up ?
dk : you know , i believe that 's credit , there for the role of <unk> in the policy .
the recognition is slow to be in the united states , no question , but the uk does that you just and in other countries that happens , they 're now .
the people are doing that , recognizing that they 're going to happiness is you should , if you , politics , thinking .
it 's a while you , and the people will discuss , if you <unk> exploring those cases , or whether they <unk> exploring those cases , so we need to this debate pretty soon .
how you 're lucky because it 's very differently depending upon it , as you think and if you know , that <unk> even think , or if you know , that <unk> even think .
this is politics are , i think , in the next few years .
in the united states <unk> you , that <unk> the population to measure .
this is , i think , in the next , or two decades of the national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this topic is , or should at least the most important political debate , people would be over the next few years .
thank you for the invention of behavioral economics .
thank you , danny <unk> .
i 'm jane <unk> . i make games .
i think of now for 10 years , online . and my goal for the next decade is , it 's easy to do , the world in reality to save , in <unk> to save .
i have a design for . i want more people to convince them , including you all , more time with the play a greater and <unk> games to spend .
now , and we spend three billion hours per week with <unk> .
some of you might think , `` this is a whole time for games . ''
maybe something to much time , when you think about how many problems we desperately in the real world to solve .

three billion hours per week are n't even close enough to the most of the world to solve .
in fact , i 'm convinced that , if we have the next century on this planet to survive to , we have this time to dramatically increase .
i 've calculated that took time , 21 billion hours <unk> per week .
that appears first maybe something <unk> , so again , i do it , so it , i ca : if we have issues like hungry , poverty , climate change , global conflict and obesity want to solve , i think , we need to try to play online for one or 21 billion hours per week , the end of the next decade to play .
no , i mean it really seriously .
why ? this picture of -- quite right , why i believe that play , so critical for the survival of the human species in the future . seriously .
this is a her the photographers <unk> <unk> .
he wanted to the feelings to play catch . so it 's going on the players have a camera around .
this is one of the classic of the play .
if you ca n't think are experts , we think , you might be some of nuances in this picture .
you probably this sense of urgency , something , but also the antithesis of concentration , one in the problems of a really tough problem .
if you also play , you see some of nuances . here , after the top <unk> eyes and the mouths are a sign of the optimism . the eyebrows in terms of surprise .
this is a player , the edge of so-called distilled victory .
oh , you know that . ok , well . so we have some are here .
a <unk> the force is a result , this very good news is that they had n't know that it possible .
it was almost beyond the imagination .
and if you it , they 're shocked to keep them in fact , that can do . this is a <unk> victory .
this player 's a moment ago , distilled the force .
and this is it , what we on millions of their faces of <unk> around the world , you must , if we have the next century in attacking . the face of those , as well , all odds on the edge of distilled victory .
well , unfortunately , we see more of the face in real life , if we difficult problems to face .
i call it as the `` in life i a bad '' <unk> . and it 's actually my face , you see ? yes , ok .
that i am , like , `` in life i a bad '' <unk> do .
this is a graffiti and in my former home in berkeley , california , where i in my ph.d. studying why we in games are better than in real life .
this is a problem , that many player .
we think that we have the reality is not as well , are like in games .
and i 'm not just a successful , though that it .
we reach in <unk> more . i mean , in the connection with the motivation , something meaningful to do , inspired to deal with each other .
if we in a <unk> are , i believe that many of us , in the best we 'll turn them , anytime and immediately <unk> are , you 're the ability to try , so long as much needed , it after the failure to try .
and in reality , if we fail , if we on the barriers to hit , feel we often different .
we feel overwhelmed . we feel well . we feel threatened , perhaps most depressed , frustrated , or <unk> .
these feelings , we 've never , if we play games , in games are there they simply not .
and this is it , what i am a student to look at .
why is it in games impossible to think , you could n't it 's all do ?
how we can these feelings of the play in the reality is able to ?
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , that the ideals that environment , made a problem solving it .
and i have some things we found that epic weak ties in <unk> as possible .
so , first , if you in one of online 're entering , in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of characters that are willing , you a <unk> mission <unk> , right .
but not just some mission , but a mission that fit perfectly to her current level of the game that well , right ?
so do this .
they have never a task , you ca n't solve .
but always the edge of their skills , so to do better . but there 's no unemployment in the world of warcraft .
you is not around and turns <unk> . it 's always very specific and something important to do .
and there 's tons of staff .
where they also go , hundreds of people , with them together to their epic journey were going to conclude .
that we have in real life , not so easy , this sense that in a <unk> of employees are willing to stand .
and there 's this epic story , this inspiring story , why we 're there and what we have to do .
then we can get this whole positive feedback .
they have is a kind of `` level , '' and `` plus-one strength . '' i heard or `` plus-one intelligence . ''
this constant , feedback , there 's not in real life .
if i do this stage was leaving , i did n't , plus-one talk , and plus-one crazy idea , <unk> crazy idea .
i get in real life that feedback .
so , the problem <unk> like the world of warcraft , is that it that satisfaction is , anytime , the edge of distilled victory to stand out that we get our whole time in these <unk> spend .
they 're just better than the reality .
to have all the world of <unk> together <unk> million years trying to the virtual problems of <unk> to solve .
that 's not necessarily something bad .
it might sound bad .
but to it 's time in context to see ago , i <unk> million years , began our first <unk> tries to go .
the first upright primate and so .
ok , so if we talk about , how much time we 're now with play spend , does that just a sense , when you , the time in the scale at the human development of eyes , holding , which is .
but also be appropriate . because it turns out , that we , by we all of this time to play using , in fact that change , what we as people in the able to .
we 're going to us to collaborative , we are , very much beings .
this is the truth . that i think .
at once they that 's that recently from a researcher at the carnegie mellon university was published , the average young man , in a country with strong <unk> spend 10,000 hours with <unk> to the 21st century . age .
so , 10,000 hours , is a very interesting number , from two reasons :
first again , for children in america are <unk> hours of the exact <unk> , you in the school to spend , of the five . grade to the end by the high school -- if you never been missing .
so we have this is a complete <unk> , young people just learning , what it , a good players , like anything other , what they school in learning .
and may have any of the new book of malcolm gladwell , `` <unk> '' to read .
so you know of his theory of success , the theory of success of 10,000 hours .
they are based on the great the research on the <unk> that , if we have 10,000 hours with the <unk> studies of any subject to the 21st century . by spending , we be able to coming in it .
we are so good at , what that to do the most people the world .
so , what we have here , is a complete generation of young people that <unk> .
the big question is so , `` what exactly are the players are really good ? ''
because if we that out how could , we have of that i 've never been there <unk> human potential to spend .
so many people have we currently in the world , the least an hour a day with <unk> spend .
that are our <unk> . 500 million people that information -- well , `` something '' .
and the next decade we have another one billion players , the information -- well , what that are .
if you do it 's still do n't have heard ,
the industry that <unk> , the energy to save and on <unk> work , instead of the <unk> , so players around the world , especially in india , china , brazil , online can play .
you 're expecting an extra one billion player in the next decade .
so we have total of 1.5 billion player .
so i started to think , what it is , at us these games to coming .
here are the four things that i found . first , : <unk> .
ok , imagine if you like the extreme <unk> ago .
<unk> is that urge , right to do something , a challenge to coming , together with the believe that we have a <unk> hope kept on success .
i believe , that a <unk> the force is possible , and that it , worth , it to try , right .
players are not sit around .
are masters of spiders poet of social nets .
there 's a lot more research , the show that we are more like , after we do with you have played , even if you us , it 's defeated correctly .
the reason for this is that 's lots of trust it requires , with somebody a game to play .
we trust is that somebody time with us feeling that the rules <unk> be that we did the goal , and to the end , by .
so the technologies that we see that grow from going to trust and each other .
as a result of that we build their social relations .
<unk> productivity . fantastic !
you know , there 's a reason , why the <unk> of <unk> 22 hours per week he plays , as <unk> .
the reason is that , if we play , we 're actually have the hard to work , as if we relax , or do nothing .
we know that we as human beings that can work , if we make hard , where they work done .
and are always ready , hard to work , if you the right to get .
and ultimately , very epic , meaning .
players love it , part of awe <unk> missions <unk> got to be .
here 's a <unk> the the right light to the back . you are lots of wikipedia , the <unk> the world .
the largest <unk> the world , almost 80,000 entries that is the world of warcraft <unk> .
five million people use it every month .
they have more information about the world of warcraft the 've seen as about some other issue in each other <unk> the world .
they create a very epic story .
they create a very epic source of knowledge about the world of warcraft .
ok , that are so four superpowers , to a single result . are <unk> , hopeful individuals .
it are people , believe that you a single change the world can .
and the only problem is that they believe , you can the virtual worlds are changing , but not the real .
this is the issue that i 'm going to try .
edward <unk> is a <unk> .
his work is great . he looked at , why people that much time , energy and money in <unk> spend .
and he says , `` we 're going to the idea of not less than a <unk> in virtual worlds , and <unk> . ''
and that from an economist . so he 's obvious .
and he says ...
not like i -- i think of games , i 'm a <unk> .
so he says , that makes actually make sense , because the player can in <unk> more to as in real life .
you can in games in their social ties with each other than in real life . they get more valuable feedback and rewards in games than in real life .
so , he says , it is entirely obvious that are more time in the virtual world as in the real time .
i agree that first time , that 's obvious .
but it 's definitely not <unk> .
we need to start to the real world in a game to turn into .
my inspiration comes from an event , the 2,500 years of shared .
there 's this ancient cube , from <unk> . you know ?
of these fantastic sketch it was <unk> .
and that were kind of the first of humans evolved <unk> .
and if you with the mechanics of the ancient greek <unk> <unk> are familiar , you might this story . the story about , and why games have invented by .
according <unk> were playing games , more <unk> , in the kingdom <unk> as a famine , invented .
supposedly , there 's such a great famine in the king of <unk> , to a crazy idea of his .
the people suffering . the people who were .
it was an extreme situation . you took one of the solution .
so they invented , according <unk> , that <unk> and agreed to a national strategy . in one day would you eat . the next day , you 'd play .
and they were so much in the <unk> one , there play , so fascinating these are and us with <unk> , <unk> productivity with you to remember that would that 's nothing to eat , there .
and then , the next day , you 'd play . and the next day would you eat .
and according <unk> allowing them as 18 years for that famine , by them in one day , eating and the next to come .
as well , i think , that we now play a .
we put play a to the suffering from the real world to get away .
we put play a to all due to avoid that in the real world 's not work , everything that in real life does n't satisfaction is , and we bring us what we need of the play .
but this must not been the current .
that 's exciting .
according <unk> was , 18 years , the famine , not better . so i decided to the king , a final <unk> that we need .
they did the kingdom , in two halves .
they played a <unk> and the winner got to a distilled , it .
they were <unk> and now , the quest for a new home . they were just so many people , how it food to survive there and looking to the rest for an area , in the they are able to .
this sounds crazy , ?
but the latest <unk> show that the <unk> that later that -- got up , the same dna as the old <unk> have .
so , and scientists recently , attitude that <unk> ' crazy story actually true .
and we geologists found evidence of global cooling , almost 20 years of it is what the famine , you could .
so i could take these crazy story to vote .
you might have actually their people through play rescued , by them , 18 years for in games , escaped and , and then this as far , and so much about that are playing learned that they provided by the whole civilization have saved .
so that we can also .
we play since 1994 warcraft .
it was the first <unk> in the world of <unk> . that was 16 years ago .
they were at 18 years for <unk> , we play for 16 years of warcraft .
so what i , we 're ready for our own <unk> game .
so , they sent the half of civilization , on the quest for a new world . so i mean , 21 billion <unk> per week .

i know , they 're going to ask : `` how do we are the real world in games ? '' and that question i mean work in recent years at the center for the future is devoted .
we have this banner , in our office in palo alto , it on them out how we the future to be .
we do n't want to the future , before to say .
what we want , is the future to create .
we want to the best results , imagine . and then people to powerful , this idea in the reality to prototype .
we imagine epic wins , and give people the ways that you to achieve .
i 'll show you very quickly . three games that i designed to have to try to people in epic wins in their own future to give yourself .
this is `` the world without oil . ''
this game is of 2007 .
it 's a <unk> , you a <unk> get to .
the <unk> 's invented , but we have enough <unk> , so it for them , it 's and you very real life in fact , without oil . so , if you to play and register , they tell us , where you live . and then get them <unk> in real , to show you how much oil costs , what 's not there , because food , those is going to transport those are going to school closed organizations are , whether it 's the middle there . and they 're going to figure out how you very real life make if it 's true if it . and we ask them , about to blog , videos or the photos , to .
we have this game with <unk> players in 2007 , and tested . and we have you ever since over the last three years , too .
and i can tell you , it was a changing the experience .
nobody wants to life change , because it 's good for the environment is , or because we do it should .
but if you , distilled adventures are and said , you get , `` of us about the oil . ''
this is a fascinating about adventure , that you about .
they find out , how they were going to . the most of gamers have the game <unk> habits that .
so we 've gone for the next <unk> play a bigger , at target , you 'd rather than just <unk> .
we have the game , `` <unk> '' at the center for the future .
point is the calculation of <unk> that the people just , 23 years on the planet , and there .
this massive supercomputer called `` global <unk> <unk> '' , of course .
the call to players , to sign , we have almost like a `` <unk> '' <unk> designed .
you know the jerry <unk> , where it that `` <unk> '' there . you have the astronaut , the scientists , the <unk> , and you can save the world .
but in our game , instead of the only five people , we say , everybody 's in <unk> , and it 's our job , the future for energy , food , health , security and the future of social justice to create .
8,000 players who played at the five weeks for .
they found in incredibly creative solutions that they read that if you , `` <unk> '' google .
and the last game we bring the three . march out . it 's a game in collaboration with the world .
you look at the end , get them from the world bank , the distinction , `` social <unk> , '' the end by 2010 .
we 're working with the universities , sub-saharan africa and they invite a , social <unk> to learn .
we have a comic book on this . we have `` level , '' for <unk> understand , <unk> , sustainability , vision and his ingenuity .
i want you all invite , this game with young people to share , the world , in <unk> , of benefits , put together , their social enterprises to the world to save .

we 've all these superpowers , <unk> productivity , the ability , where social nets to knit , <unk> and that for <unk> meaning .
i really hope that we put together in history play games to knock on this planet , another century to survive .
and i hope that they 're going to me like to design and play .
if i the next decade <unk> , i 'm at two things that 's safe , that we each <unk> future can create , and that we all kinds of play games can .
so i say , let the <unk> 'll start !
thanks .
i would you 'd like a little bit about what to me a few months to write an article for <unk> wired to do .
i have to write , my <unk> our questions , but i was with the kind of the <unk> already done , and i fell on that i still never in my life <unk> have to the word `` a '' that .
i read them the post .

<unk> , healthy , strong , exquisitely sensitive . ''
i have this list of a friend , according to read and had to find laughter , it seemed like this ridiculous , but i was just to `` up '' and i could n't even more <unk> , and had to stop to read and i 'll just collecting , this <unk> <unk> and the order to <unk> emotional shock .
of course was that a <unk> , old <unk> . i 've told me just thought that the copy , very old to be .
but actually it was a copy the early '80s , when i just with the school i started and so i started , my self outside of the family on building and to form , in terms of other children and the rest of the world to me around .
and god is very thankful i was no <unk> used .
i saw this post take seriously , i would in a world was born , somebody like me as a person i would , whose lives in <unk> way we got a kind of it . today , but i 'm going to the opportunity and adventure , i 've experienced , celebrated .
so i immediately the <unk> of 2009 navigated and expecting that i 'm here a <unk> 'll find .
there 's the <unk> version of this <unk> .
unfortunately , it 's not much better .
especially in shock to me the last two words , `` near <unk> '' `` well , '' and `` healthy . ''
but it 's not only to the words .
it 's about , what we think about the people think that we do with these words to describe .
it is the values , in these words stuck , and how we these values build .
our language affects our thinking and how we the world and the people to around us .
many <unk> societies , including the greek and the roman , have really believed that the way of <unk> a great force , because that , what you to <unk> , , <unk> can .
so , what we want to actually <unk> -- a those people or a powerful people ?
just been a human <unk> as a child to call , could be enough , the emissions and you an idea of the <unk> .
it would n't beautiful , you doors to open up ?
a person , for me to the has opened , was my pediatrician in the <unk> . dupont , the institute in <unk> in <unk> .
he is dr. <unk> . a <unk> , whose name , how do you see , the most americans do n't exactly right just could . so he was always , dr. p. called .
and dr. p. was always very colorful , flying and was for the work with kids as simple .
i found the time , i went in this hospital , i 'd have , just great -- to my <unk> .
i had one little exercise it turns out forever , again with these heavy , <unk> <unk> -- in different colors -- that you know how to my <unk> build . and i have this on more hated worse than anything other . i 've they hated it . i mean , i mean . i 've they hated it .
and put them , i actually , as <unk> kid with dr. p. , and that 's trying to these exercise to stop , <unk> no success .
and one day , he , of my favorite exercises at -- these exercise it was really tiring and -- -- and he said to me , `` wow , <unk> , you 're like a strong , powerful and young girl , you one day of on family portrait .
and if you get it says , i give you a hundred dollars . ''
that was obviously just a simple trick of dr. p. , so i the exercises that i do that i do n't want to the prospect that the richest five-year-old girl in the ward in the second third floor . but he has made me in fact , to the country , my daily <unk> with new eyes . they are so , it 's a new and <unk> experience .
and i wonder now , very his vision of me as strong and powerful young girl , my self being formed , and i was so imagine being able to me as a kind of the strong , powerful and <unk> person .
this is just a sample of you , as adults in <unk> the imagination of a child your view .
but how the been quoted examples of the <unk> prove that makes us our language , no room , something to figure out what we all want to count , it every single to themselves , as powerful people .
our language is behind the social changes as no , in many of a technological change that triggered by .
the medical records from , you can kind of course , say that my legs , the <unk> for <unk> , <unk> of titan , and becomes <unk> , ranging from body , it allow people , really all their opportunities to use , little bit about the borders , you your natural , which he put it has to figure out to actually , not to speak of social <unk> platforms , to people , a own identity , there , on its own way , and the way that , and , with the world , who believe that , choose .
maybe that 's so this technological change and clear , because i ever seen that 's always been one other inconvenient truth , which is that every man of society , something very <unk> and very powerful tool can give and that the human ability , adapt , our biggest plus is .
the human ability , which were -- that 's an interesting story , because people to me , and it 's ask to how i do with the odds deal , and i 'm going to you something to say , that sentence , for me never <unk> and i always very uncomfortable with it felt , the questions of people to answer , and i think , gradually i do know , why .
this phrase from the -- with the odds that lives of the idea that success or happiness . it depends on , a challenge to coming , without any of the so on top experience this shape . as if my life so successful that would , because i the kinds of falling of life with a prosthetic limb of it could , like that people to me with my disability as well .
but the truth is that we change . course , we 're talking about the challenge this shape , no matter whether you physically , emotional , or even the two days .
and i thought that 's good .
odds are not an obstacle that we <unk> need to with our lives better clear to come .
odds are easy to our lives .
and i tend to , gave , as my shadow .
sometimes i realize that he 's very mind is , sometimes it 's hard to see , but he 's time with me .
and i want to do n't , the impact and you . the very challenging the <unk> of people , degrading .
there 's in your odds and challenges , and that are just <unk> real and each person 's so slightly differently . but the question is not , whether we do with the odds are coming , or not , but how we realized that come .
so we 're not just responsible for the people that we love , <unk> to , but they also to prepare , well , so clear to come .
and we 're going to be our kids do n't have fallen , if we do you feeling that there 's going to do n't want to shift can .
you have to two things that dividing , one thing , the medical fact , an to be and to the other the social something about this , if i a 'm or not .
and to be honest , the only real and you 're disabled , i just sit down to , is that the world and says , you can take me with this definition of .
in our desire , the people to protect , the heart of and you the cold , hard to the truth about their medical a lot to communicate or even a to the quality to imagine that they expected , we need to pay attention that we 're not the that started to put that somebody actually a result is .
maybe this is in the concept , the only to pay attention , what 's in a broken , is , and how we the repair , for every single one more disability than the pathology , .
if we have a people not worth distinguishing treat , and not all its forces and opportunity to perceive and to acknowledge , we do in addition to the natural struggle , you may lead to , one another disease .
we <unk> a people , for our society , a value .
so we need to the <unk> look out and us on all of the human possibilities to focus .
the most importantly , but this is that 's between the perception of pushing and our great human ingenuity , a connection there .
we should those challenging the better not <unk> or in denial , we should n't try to them to avoid , we should they 're under the return , but it 's about , in the odds of opportunity to see it .
it 's about me , maybe it 's more , clear to imagine that we gave , not necessarily need to get to , but that we started to open , are , you to hug , the seize to stick to also , a <unk> to use and maybe even to dance .
and maybe we do it , gave , as a natural , coherent and useful to see , and we feel so through their presence not more than that had .
the year in a celebration , we spend 200 . birthday of charles darwin and when he was 150 years ago about evolution has written , darwin , in my eyes , on something very true in the human nature of this out .
i would it so what , not the most of you survive , and also not the <unk> of , but the , changes the question is adapt .
of conflicts of creativity .
not only from darwin 's work , we know that the ability to people , to survive and <unk> , from the fight the human mind is is , by conflict to turn .
so , again , change and these things are the greatest skills of people .
and maybe we know , first , from some wood and we ball are , if we really have to be .
maybe this is that the sense of the odds , a perception of these eyes , a sense of our own power .
we can so even something like to .
we can be adversities , a new meaning to the tough times beyond what about .
maybe we gave , as a change .
odds are for a change , that we still do n't have adapted .
i think , the damage , we even in danger have , is to believe that we 're normal to be .
well , honest , who is normal ?
it is not normal .
there 's the usual . that . but not the normal . and they would those poor , this person 's really to know that we want , if you really there ?
i think , not .
it would be great , if we have this paradigm of normality , a different the opportunity or the strength to it even still a little bit dangerous , proposing , they could . so we can the forces of very many kids to release and they tend to invite , very particular , and those skills in the society in .
<unk> 've got out found that we humans from the members of our society , one who claimed that have , to be and a contribution to do .
there 's cues to have the neanderthals , 60,000 years older people and people with severe , physical injuries , by have and this was perhaps , because the life in <unk> of people for a society that value was :
they have these people not as a broken and useless at ; they were as something special , and those treated .
a few years , i went in the city , in the i grew up was , in a <unk> in the `` the red zone . '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i was there with a <unk> from .
it was the summer , and i had <unk> .
and i am , as a guy behind me , `` well , if that 's not <unk> <unk> is . ''
and i turn to me , and see this her husband . i had no idea who he 's .
and i said , `` sorry , sir , we know us ? i ca n't , you . ''
and he said , `` well , i suspect , barely able to me remind .
when i they first time , i saw , i do you from the belly of her mother was getting . ''
oh , so the .
and of course , it , but then they click .
that was , dr. <unk> , a man , i just from multiple narratives of my mother about this day i knew , because i course , very typical , to my birthday , two weeks to be late came .
the doctor for <unk> diagnostics of my mother was in the vacation , and so we knew my parents the man , the me to the world . and , all .
and because i do without <unk> was born , and my feet , after them pointing , and i just a few toes , this and a few toes in the other foot , he was the <unk> , of strangers to the bad news your book .
he said to me , `` i had to your parents tell you to never going would , and it 's never <unk> be would like the other children or that you never a completely independent life lead if you could , and since they 've got me simply lying <unk> . ''
really extraordinary , i found that he <unk> my entire childhood now , whatever , if i held in <unk> in the second grade , actually had , if i do with the <unk> in the mermaid parade , <unk> way was , whatever , if i do for a fellowship , or of my <unk> wins <unk> had , and he was using these clips to his students to teach , <unk> from the <unk> medical school and the <unk> medical school .
and he called this part of his <unk> the x amount of the potential of human willing .
you can just not enough to point , how critical supplies of a factor for the quality of people can be .

you see , dr. <unk> has to be thinking .
he had understood that the medical diagnosis , and how someone to deal , two different things .
and also i quit my thinking over the time has changed , if you me the age of 15 years , they were saying , if i mean who against the legs of meat and bone <unk> have , then i would have no one second <unk> .
i want to look at which have normal work .
if you me that to ask , i 'm not so sure .
and that 's happening , because i do something with my legs , i have and not in spite of these experiences .
and perhaps could this change is also happen , because i so many people in a while i 'm , my door opened have , instead of people to go , i do or me an idea on .
and you see it really , people , you demos , their powers . <unk> can , and they 're going through .
if you it 's someone in the its own , inside of forces to activate , -- the human mind is so <unk> -- if you do this , and for anyone in a critical moment a door up , then they 're looking for these people a very good teachers .
they bring them at themselves , the doors to open .
the real importance of the word `` <unk> '' is rooted in the word `` <unk> . ''
it means that anything to bring that in this is , the potential <unk> .
again , which the potential to do we want , it ?
in the '60s years was in britain 's a <unk> done . at that were <unk> in <unk> transformed .
they call that there , `` what they 're <unk> '' in the united states , we call this as `` <unk> . ''
the students to be able to music is it .
and the a student will <unk> harder to have to get the better teacher , so forth .
they have then over a <unk> period of students , `` well enough , '' the top grade , `` very well , '' there . it was told you , they were <unk> that you very clever would . and after these three months have you really <unk> written .
and of course <unk> 's a the heart to hear that way around the <unk> been said , they were just enough .
and as it was then after the three months .
but only one of us who are still in the school were -- apart from the students , the school , throwing .
very crucial in this trial was that the teachers wo n't <unk> were .
the teachers are n't know that something changed .
you 've been just told that are the a and that are the students with the kind enough . and as you have you something teaching and turn them .
the only really at disability is a broken mind is a spirit , the broken , has no hope . he find nothing more beautiful . he 's our natural , one of curiosity . and our innate capacity to the imagination .
if we do it , but to create the human spirit , to support to continue to hope for themselves , and other people to , around . if you find , and <unk> to be then put that we do really positive .
if a spirit of those qualities that , we can be a new reality and new <unk> do .
i want to a poem by saying that , persian poet named <unk> in 14 century . '' written by the me my friend , jacques <unk> told them . and the poem called `` the god , the only four words . '' `` every child knows , not the god the name , not the god of being banned , but the god , the only four words , there and these are repeated , he says , only : come to dance with me . ''
come to dance with me . thank you .
