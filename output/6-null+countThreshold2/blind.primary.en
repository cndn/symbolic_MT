yes , good day mean , ladies , gentlemen .
very much . thanks for the references here today , to talk .
and i have to me , yes , which i imagine .
my name is christian <unk> and i 'm going to an term , <unk> in the city of food .
that are called <unk> for eight years .
and my <unk> is : one personnel to talk is an organization , and thirdly , the public policy .
so i 'm for the <unk> this city in charge .
and yes , so you do , not very popular .
i know .
and it out , and that 's something which my son , particularly like , i also <unk> .
that means that i 'm the head of the <unk> fire .
<unk> <unk> and a kilometer <unk> .
and have i thought , is a subject matter , i do you today <unk> want .
which , the topic <unk> , because this is also heard the firemen .
we 'd like the best and it for us on the worst , and that 's what jack that once said .
you know him .
he was once in general <unk> .
and then i 'm starting to do n't quite so really wrong to say .
i <unk> you a position .
so we talk , if it 's a risk is that we on , a stand , for <unk> <unk> , the rush .
many people are the way .
it being , it <unk> .

nobody seems to belong .
the suitcase heard any time .
suddenly an <unk> .
leave you that <unk> .
the police comes to fire , <unk> .
people out .
these <unk> .
, get out .
what 's because this ? to ask <unk> .
that we know , not or we ca n't it 's say .
the people leave the building .
so to cry .
some of falling , and perhaps , because it all very quickly go to .
a sudden , who .
there 's <unk> inside .
a panic , breaks out .
i am now here on .
the rest of bastards i your imagination .
but it 's no fantasy that i <unk> have . <unk> ?
this is this , in this week is happening in <unk> .
there 's such a suitcase of them .
later turned out , that only , in <unk> , nine thousand pounds of drugs that were .
but the people were just like , and that has a friend told me that tells , from the building , forced into .
it was n't told .
and it was that who suddenly , at least in the group on that my friend in my friend , i found myself .
god is `` thank you is n't panic that have , otherwise would also , and there are not so safe to run out how it .
you see , in a descriptions , in a <unk> disaster is to communicate , a very important .
communication is that matters because the people at this is literally after the communications <unk> .
they want to know what 's because we go .
it used in the good , old was time that for the authorities , pretty simple .
we 've just ca n't told or we 've got lied .
why ?
because it 's called the <unk> and there .
you , this fair to say , god , the people get in panic , because we say , not going to the truth or we say the <unk> .
this is in a time the social media , in a time of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public <unk> , in a time , she and public television , as possible .
just and really , therefore , because it 's one is n't have been is , and secondly , mostly are doing , the past when i do n't know , over the event that report .
you remember , perhaps , the one in the hudson river , in which is a year , ago .
the first they are about it was at twitter .
by someone , on the ferry , and just and really , right <unk> , here 's an airplane predictive ; and we save the people now .
that was no <unk> .
you see that we 're dependent on , today , `` and really , of place , and the truth to say , and very <unk> to inform .
because usually we 're the course , the past , the supposedly , the truth will know , because when we do n't have to course , to notice that we just <unk> information to pass .
that are public media , or , private media , either it 's not very thought , or they do it also not .
and therefore , we 're going in the food , and that 's also something that even by the media has gone are , we think about how we in the future with <unk> deal .
and to do we going to the good old <unk> back out .
however , just as a form of <unk> .
that means that we 're going to the next few years about a hundred <unk> in the <unk> build that , some of you know that still , <unk> , if it 's going to <unk> coming .
once it was so .
you may be you know , what 's three in short , once in short , once a long and even just means .
i know it 's not anymore .
we 're going to the right now is suburban with all <unk> that we view of taking place , so <unk> , of facebook , twitter , over the radio <unk> also at night , over the tv and all over the internet and the local media and so , and immediately , to the course , with <unk> to pick up the information on to get .
and we know , we need to there 's very quickly and <unk> operate and we need to there 's very quickly and <unk> -- so , because the zones , and citizens are otherwise frightened .
and we ultimately , and , you think that , what we tell you want .
communication in the crisis , or in the disaster is so one in a question of strength of all media , to stand , and it 's also a question of the credibility .
recognize is our biggest problem , because the zones , and citizens to say , either , oh , the proportion time again , is it 's not , or they say , the <unk> us , it 's much worse than it in reality is .
we have therefore , good about what 's done with facebook and twitter , in .
and that you may have some of in them the media from .
we have a <unk> in the food <unk> had .
and that 's a place called the chemical bomb .

this problem is just a lot of bombs 've never works and are , like , in <unk> under one in the food <unk> .
and there , we were from one elderly gentleman , the be some extent , he so beautiful in the protocol , to wanted , we were now , he had seen as you <unk> <unk> like it 's and now <unk> he 's the authorities as to be informed that 's a bomb . on the background .
the way since the name of several older , the cases in the whole <unk> .
we 'll see , what we still do anything to .
this bombs to immediately shifts of place , not <unk> , but in fact be .
and so we then in <unk> park , `` and really , one , in every sense the word , a bomb , the circle .
and the first time in history of the city of the communications , facebook and twitter , going to do with the consequence of the <unk> far over <unk> <unk> 've followed .
and the media was thrilled . laughter in the background .
we had n't even with are the phone , but the have <unk> and <unk> , all over <unk> and twitter .
this was a great effect for us , because the credibility that is clear , increase over these social media .
just so , they have to me also a sign that there , when i stop to .
i can go from this is not at the watch out .
this is the credibility that , because the first of these social media , the advantage of that you very much information to pass .
it 's not very <unk> are , because the members that there are or the <unk> how to calls them , a high <unk> have .
secondly , which we 've done .
if anything not true , writes that someone who immediately , so that the credibility that , i just talked to have to clear up , because of the entire community , the reports that there is .
and it 's a very high <unk> so , so if anything that 's wrong , it can also very quickly to correct side .
and we have a huge <unk> .
i said yes , <unk> the fun to find , as a bomb , in <unk> park , up goes .
and so we from all the things that in recent years happened , and it are much more <unk> happens as intense encounter a still think , as intense encounter a third .
also the food , every day of such a home for an endowment .
a bomb , in fact to be in a park , is certainly not such a .
but they can also , and then <unk> we now , in <unk> be found , and then i am that it with our <unk> and try to the in seven meters deep <unk> .
and if the , if you see in munich , you think of other cities , if the then in fact to , because it 's called a <unk> , the you have conventional not to defuse that can , that 's been now , be a variety of houses , and , so look like before .
and that to communicate it 's important , one , because it 's in a in a world <unk> <unk> which is necessary , communication to do anything to leave you also to panic can avoid it to give to worry about to carry that the people of these are to give to worry about to carry that the people in the are able to look at the difficult situation , to .
and the social media to help us , and a credible , because ultimately , they all the communications are involved , and it 's not just a <unk> <unk> is how we play in the <unk> , <unk> and certainly , still in the <unk> for large part .
and so now is <unk> not just a job of the authorities , not just a job of the fire or the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , red cross were etc. , but of communication in the catastrophe and to tackle a catastrophe about us all of .
and <unk> this has shown .
there 's about twitter and of facebook , a lot of the aid did , if you also know , and you still so overwhelmed , because suddenly <unk> of people to any <unk> build wanted and you know all , where the <unk> are .
this is also , there 's still a lot to do , indeed , the public communication in <unk> , but the unprecedented solidarity with the <unk> and the redeveloping has just shown that the social media from a <unk> , from a communication to do n't even more to think are .
and i hope that i do you a little more convinced of you have to this media , yes , for the beautiful things of life often is used , in <unk> its meaning and purpose it , and that we as a city , for the flight , <unk> of this is , this instrument , in the future , and then , new , and very different as well going to her , to the citizens to use the zones , and citizens and so the end i now , and thank me very much for your attention , i do you have the time , barely seen have .
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm <unk> differently .
i 'm a writer and <unk> , just have heard .
and i 'm now , they also , and , really a <unk> the main reasons .
what it is that i was there <unk> make me , that i 'll ask you also in a few years ago .
before i do that , i have to but a few things <unk> .
the first is , , i believe that we are really to life .
that we no stories about it could live .
and i believe that 's very much more <unk> , <unk> , <unk> stories , there , as the entertainment business actually produced by side .
then i think , that the internet , the infinite and then , of fact , as well , do n't <unk> really neat <unk> will .
and four , i 'm <unk> convinced of that people that were created , to be creative .
and that you happier , once you can be creative people can .
ever more people are happy , if you get it 's the world .
it logically .
these better world is now , just a byproduct .
in the first line , i am , i said , a storyteller .
and the story that i tell you want to begin to midnight , in a <unk> , in the just happy <unk> the will .
this is <unk> .
and it 's <unk> <unk> birthday .
now get them from the <unk> and the singing , not so much with , because in the moment , it at midnight 's gone , something happens with her .
it 's something happens in your mind , in your body , with their perception .
and she has n't really word for .
they do n't know , what 's just happened .
i 've all the word for .
i call that the wizard of <unk> .
you see the one side <unk> and look in <unk> and everything is very white .
i , the feeling i 'm somehow , <unk> .
<unk> .
and the other side , we have the two and then in oz -- with very very much color .
and it was , in , once told that i 'd better <unk> and write , when that i 'm drawing .
so the first of , what <unk> now with their new perceptions of this is a stranger , man with <unk> <unk> hair , the ago , it says , you very seriously at , and says , very much congratulations , your life is over .
this is <unk> .
and <unk> educates <unk> about it on that you to a very special kind of people heard .
she was as <unk> born .
are people that . ab : your <unk> have to her lifetime to be .
who of you know <unk> ?
very good .
you imagine , the <unk> it <unk> n't swords , if you go together meeting , but <unk> from the pocket .
so these cube , <unk> , <unk> , anything possible .
what really important is , the players have no insight , on their <unk> .
we know , yes , not , when we die .
i wish , in a long life , but we know what 's just not .
it could tomorrow 's all been over time .
and so it 's in my players , so .
you know , do not to how they because actually can play .
that , and again , every lost minute that the last been to be .
a player , his entire lifetime <unk> , <unk> , the <unk> like a candle that <unk> will .
now you can , wondering : if that because this is dangerous , why are the then all ?
the answer is very clear : that .
without play , without the players to a around , <unk> , all of gray , and only if a player does , he 's actually alive .
that were to play .
so .
this story of <unk> and as you now the world of players <unk> , your first challenge is , and , inevitably , <unk> love , is the story that i tell you want .
and that in a <unk> .
the first season has 12 to follow , sorry , i 'm here is a <unk> happens that i just to 're seeing what you have .
so , 12 , in the first season with a certain length of each , five to seven minutes .
this kind of <unk> , a result , the other , you <unk> told that you know .
that television , for his <unk> nothing else .
this is not new .
and if it all be , if only ' i now one is finished .
and he does not here .
now let 's but , we .
we go , to <unk> back .
what 's the most famous one sentence in the film , or from the series ?
it can now , there , right .
thanks .
as if we that if you could have .
that to hit on my players , which is not to .
of it 's all kinds of giving .
there 's so many different games .
you think of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and so , and so on .
and that <unk> 's also the number of gamers .
and so that will be here , lots of stories that all be told you want .
now would be the next question : who is because all going ?
i , already quite a huge amount of opinion of me .
i think me for sufficient smart and in such a creative .
but i know that a hundred brain , no longer producing as one , it 's mine is .
so it came right to the idea that you the crowd , in the process of pulling in .
what would , if we <unk> not just brook or to me , but even <unk> ?
so if you say , we invite you very very much , of this <unk> with the thing .
you imagine , for example , in the result , three diving into a <unk> on , they really neat to find , because he you for example of her grandfather of them .
and they 're a giant fan of <unk> .
then you can now just , with the modern technology is that yes n't even more so hard , a <unk> do .
and that they invite the <unk> up , where it right , and that 's really cool <unk> , the really interested in the audience down this is .
i mean , it 's not anywhere , , but it ends up the right there , where it up to .
that really nice thing is that we the internet .
and the internet , yes , really do anything .
so , every medium is it allows us .
that means you as viewers , you can write , drawing , spin , and they do want .
and if we also now , this structure through .
this looks <unk> bit of <unk> web , right ?
so this <unk> , what common set up will .
and i 'm really <unk> convinced of that the internet was born to pick exactly this kind of stories to tell .
it just doing , unfortunately , not so many , or at all that none .
so , now go , i but even still a step further and making the audience have to the players are .
because in a <unk> .
because you to become characters from the series meeting , against people in the real environment , as these <unk> on your phone .
phrases , this , you are also all very well , something like , mobile <unk> and <unk> <unk> entertainment .
this wonderful areas that , just very rapidly developing countries .
and the i do n't you can , because i do over again , 20 minutes , i 'd need .
we ca n't even together .
everybody 's time off of three parts .
the first part is the <unk> , the second part is the <unk> and then we have the <unk> .
with this <unk> i could before the jury of the moment , i got this to detect , the <unk> innovation <unk> convince them .
the have to me the price for the best <unk> given .
and i need to say , these jury , which was from officials from the bank , of the <unk> , <unk> and so forth .
so good people , you want to my .
and if i want to convince you can , here with my : the internet right to use the narrative structures to revolutionize the way , still better world , i think , i can actually every convince them .
so .
everybody 's time on this : why is also , because now that ?
because i 've been alone in the names all areas covered by side .
we have to say , first of the <unk> , who is now , i 'm running , you 're running , everybody 's time .
now , then that die .
in the series of it 's very much died .
everybody 's time now , which means everybody must be a die .
and then , as well , everybody 's time running in terms of everyone can be part , if it do want .
this is i really important .
i come , from the <unk> and there 's nothing worse in my opinion , , as if it 's a <unk> will .
i do n't know , if you 've seen that .
if you in the theater , and then it 's the actor , so in the auditorium and all this : oh god , you 're not me .
and this is it 's not .
so it 's volunteer at .
and nobody has to .
he can also just people to be .
the reason why i german , speaking is that the entire project , the german , will be , why do n't .
that has also a few reasons .
i 'm with this project <unk> while the way , and i was again and wondered : go , but in english , they 're the bigger , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that i can just say , the german <unk> is the third of the world .
the <unk> is the english , then it 's the spanish , and then the german .
now it 's not so , when i would we in some small niche move .
and i believe that really , if it also other people that 's like me that the people will be grateful to be for something that 's not by any <unk> <unk> , where the end , then everybody <unk> and every off <unk> that was .
if that everything that goes , i do it would have , then goes the result now the first <unk> <unk> online .
and if they 're wondering , why i 'm here in a <unk> , where it 's put under the headline <unk> worth , <unk> it .
that i also a couple of the time .
i love <unk> .
not just <unk> .
i 'm also very reliant on of <unk> and <unk> .
a few <unk> were also , and <unk> .
and i can really just say that all know , incredibly important is , and incredibly <unk> .
but it uses , it 's nothing , as it gets .
and my project is just <unk> thing where i just let 's all taken out of have , what i was so i 've got .
and it applied to have .
and yet it 's good .
i can really just say .
so , if now , who thinks , i want to have been my part that , i had degrees ' one idea <unk> character or i , ai drawing <unk> cartoon , or what that , that 's also have already now .
you find us , the internet .
on facebook .
well , like this as the speakers about .
yes , <unk> ' i also .
welcome to , you can study memory process ?
question of them .
you can study memory process ?
you , because at all remember , in your life ever 's happened ?
they 've still <unk> that ?
who has who can , all remind you ?
it go to do n't .
so you can study memory process ?
apparently been .
thank you .
no , just like that we want it 's like to do n't do .
and then i would be the talk , probably fairly quickly .
let 's good evening , my name is samuel <unk> .
the talk today at night , i 've chosen , because he two of my passions , or my two great love right now comes together .
i ' , here in the near the computer studied and i ' i just with the bits and of bytes busy , the right now that big through the world .
and <unk> certain time i 'm also now as a coach , and who was in private and professional field of the way .
the one side and i so with the world , very much too , the other side , i 'm now it in the human <unk> <unk> <unk> , so how does that one that 's the human beings ?
how do you because that change ?
the to a parallel out .
i was recently in a very interesting discussion of artificial intelligence , <unk> <unk> .
so , the question was : when we can , when , when we can build a computer , that works like the human brain ?
so , and i think , there are we 've been pretty close .
so i think , so two , three hundred years , no longer need that 's not anymore .
but , let me , we do , why you that 's why that maybe <unk> it needs .
so the comparison , between the computer on the one side and our brains to the other side .
if we the computer , then based yes , everything , so your smartphone , you a tablet , you <unk> and these cameras and all of intelligent refrigerators somewhere on <unk> little chip .
he called the cpu , central <unk> <unk> .
these parts are assembled from <unk> transistors .
the word has certainly been asking anyone heard and in <unk> it will always like a triangle , the arts .

in our computer in our cpu , we have , i ' i do <unk> ago about five hundred million of small parts .
and the turn it 's crazy , mess .
we can store that stuff we we calculate the things , we have degrees ' you with albert einstein 's say , listen , 'n computer can do anything can be very much , very quickly , but actually , it just zero and one that .
more he ca n't .
he 's actually quite made me .
that 's time you compare with our brain .
our brain , as the smallest unit of the neuron , the neuron , and we have them , because i <unk> , a hundred billion , so a hundred billion neurons are in our gray matter of up here in there .
this beautiful but is , our our neurons have not only three fundamental connections , but the have to <unk> a neuron .
and that makes a <unk> <unk> of , just because it 's beautiful , is about 10 trillion .
that , with 14 zeroes <unk> .
so , because you see , the complexity of the brain is to make a higher than that , what we now , when computers .
we want to the <unk> time to say , maybe the , or another idea of the , the first supercomputer that had their own power station on up , ha , who were , and with the <unk> the <unk> was the campus <unk> <unk> .
our <unk> <unk> sometimes it 's , but the box up here it takes about 20 watts .
and the is , and this is , the equivalent of two of bananas , so more you do n't and she 's showing up there 's wonderful .
if we now <unk> giant good part up here , <unk> giant a calculator with <unk> , why we use the then not , why that we then things ?
maybe you know the one or another this out in the internet , so , the human nature uses only 10 percent of the brain , buy you now this <unk> to <unk> brain to be .
and <unk> because they 're wrong , the advertising is a little bit .
ten percent , perhaps , but our brain is yes , throughout our evolution , of grew that , yes <unk> smaller , in the middle of us is still our <unk> with the inside , anything other , <unk> educated .
that 's probably wo n't happen , because we do n't that we use .
why it seems to then that we the top of <unk> let me ?
maybe you know , the notion of <unk> ?
the i compared , the , so beautiful with the iceberg , if you the iceberg , in the ocean , is the top so the top , then there 's the ocean , down there 's a <unk> .
and these 10 percent up , that this is that 's what our sense , our <unk> mind is , <unk> going , but <unk> percent , there 's a giant <unk> , <unk> .
we <unk> the thing we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> we <unk> <unk> slow but we <unk> creative .
and to time <unk> on this memory back , maybe you know the one or other people with <unk> memory .
people , the project , much more detail can remember when i do n't seen . i ' in the situation <unk> , and the tell you <unk> , i ' said yes , but yes , but , where you know that ?
that 's there 's very , there 's a particular , called a <unk> , so someone with <unk> , somebody the most on a field <unk> , the excellent treatment is that has a so good <unk> memory , it was in a plane , he got , in a plane , in a helicopter , so fast is , he then ow , not , over rome in , , rome to view , so rome — is yes , now : ow , not necessarily the city , , after years ago , a giant signs of myself on and has started to rome to draw .
and that 's not a way , so here , so the river , and there is , that , no , every home , every single door , and every window , he once seen , he <unk> , it could be back to paper into .
how do is now that ?
so why ca the that , why we ca n't that , well , he 's also be very close to the <unk> bit more access on his <unk> percent of the craft .
now we use the yes , but why i can now , not at the moment to <unk> last night , remember , in the details of ?
'n <unk> <unk> of me has to interesting about what 's done .
he has even for example , you 've been working and has a rape was that had her experience is completely eliminated that , and , your mind , that <unk> <unk> the brain , that 's not happening , that 's gone .
and it 's going to make up the very well , right .
now went , but it , and <unk> to do .
there , in a very safe session , the end or after this event back to , do n't even more active remember this was , she was then the hallmark of the car see , these people <unk> , that was not <unk> , that was under its feet , and .
and actually is with the hallmark of the state 's go .
the second what i think it 's found that was , he has a lady in <unk> suppose that has told that her mother , and alice in wonderland read , when they 're small , so four years .
because i sat them on my lap , your mother and her mother has been reading .
and then he has her , in a trance , goes , but the time ago .
then , and i started to read , she was four , that happens is , they could then still do n't read , today can look at this .
and then you have said , he said , i tell me , <unk> .
they 've actually a specimen from alice in wonderland found , right on this side the lyrics go up , the lady and i read .
the brain , so this page as she was <unk> , as a picture .
then we could you read .
so , we actually have access , but we seem to because the normal life , we <unk> kind <unk> to have to us not to <unk> .
, now it and we yes , not that event , in fact , but how <unk> have said , he 's a a picture of that way , a a <unk> , we can store , rather , our adjusted , so that , what we see that , what we smell , that , what we hear that , what we taste and that , what we feel , hey , if you now <unk> at a yellow <unk> think and how it 's really <unk> <unk> , you have <unk> sense , like the taste , very popular example .
and , it was now <unk> long tonight , put them , <unk> comfortable , ha , <unk> bit above and , you can i ask you to conclude , they just a very quickly . your eyes .
and remember , a very 're , one incident in the recent past , yeah .
they take the first , what comes .
and , if you 're doing , you might notice that you to this memory of a visual part .
they get , maybe a picture , maybe as a movie ?
some of that 's not only on , because we felt that normally do , but that they make the first time i realized that .
and if you see that , it be that they 're either in the movie , from their eyes , all experience , or how they are unable to see on a canvas .
this one , we call <unk> , the other <unk> .
thank you , they allowed to the final thought back to solve , to the eyes grew back up .
who has , because a visual information to get , let 's hand up ?
yes , there , but <unk> ' a few hands up , that 's so , 'n third , i would say , this is that 's what i expected of have , it 's it 's actually something that we so often do that it 's the first moment , not sure .
well , ' <unk> on .
<unk> what 's also is beautiful , of memories , if you memories <unk> , is yes , not just that memory , up , <unk> <unk> feeling that we <unk> a positive that event and i was , the one or other people who see , there was so , that was beautiful , there were , yes , they laugh , is the memory may still there , actually it and we do with memory , beautiful or other feelings .
and now here 's what you move .
<unk> everything that was , well , the our brain power of the no difference between what we actually remember , and the , what we just imagine , what we could .
and that you can try out , if you to home <unk> down and to the future , imagine that still not happening is , they are similar information to do something , if , to remember , what the past .
and , , you know , but when you are these stories that , that tells the situation round , of time .
then , hey , there 's happening and that , and that was so beautiful , and ever known for these stories behind , more beautiful , mostly the stories , hey , there were the people , a lot <unk> , there was the evening , a situation , there was the sunset , a lot of romantic , there was the waterfall is still much higher .
if we mean , in stopping to do , so if we really our memories that change , why do we do that does n't take action , i 'll ask them ?
<unk> , when i like i came , has to me my uncle is an image showing , of his hut in switzerland .
a picture , it 's also a very hut .
just , the image is , <unk> bit more than the shack , so it 's artistic freedom , he told me , well , there 's cabin <unk> bit around , there is , 'n bit more of grass verge of , there 's a beautiful dog that there by the sun moves on the alps , that 's quite a picture of the shack , not to make .
and why do we do that 's not with our own thoughts , our own memories , hey , what bothers me , because , i guess that still more fun doing , what i there is think ?
they 've actually make a freedom and in their own thoughts .
<unk> you know , so some people , that you see the morning , if you just like this can have eyes , which is because this ?
yes , ' thing you 've made , i felt the <unk> through the head .
really all the night and this idea of made me , you go .
i think it 's vice versa , he made the idea not going .
the son <unk> friend of me <unk> little depressed , when he went to go up , because his mother in <unk> stayed , and he has you just awful missed .
what the father has done , so he , every night , he sat down and has said , has been wondering , so , what was that most beautiful , what 's happening today ?
what was that most beautiful , use in the time , and then he 's him to make , it <unk> let , it was just tell you can make , which is good happened .
and , within two weeks went 's the son is doing .
and then it was also okay , that -- way is that is yes , back to visit .
and the is today , that 's at the youth of done with the , is one of the <unk> people that i know .
it , not the memories , influence , , how we are , but it 's our focus on , our focus on the idea that we use .
and how much energy we rely on around , or use .
so if you <unk> <unk> thought <unk> or say , that , today now : ow , that 's so , <unk> this practice , but i really not , then they make it 's , but let 's like , you might tom cruise in this <unk> into the movie , he has this , that these <unk> computer , where he did the files <unk> <unk> , they do that , but also time , for you picture that <unk> have this , well , not quite so one of a sheet , they say , well , <unk> now <unk> happens , but , can , way to .
what ham , we because <unk> ' yet , ah , is a , yes , look over time , <unk> , yes , that has to me <unk> ' real love , man , that was that was beautiful , well ?
and then they take that 's time with .
they take that , in their <unk> and you make this work .
or if you who <unk> following , <unk> , is it <unk> their your boss , or your wife , or her husband , <unk> , laughter , they <unk> .
so , take it 's the image , put them <unk> funny hat on , hey .
<unk> <unk> <unk> with <unk> , let 's the background of horses jump , yes , they laugh , why are you ?
because they <unk> imagine , because these kinds of fun .
and you can be much better with the situation , suddenly we deal .
ca : man memories so , ?
no , i think our brain has been so much greater capacity to make it all it can .
it does , but nothing , because we can free to vote , how strong , we focus and how important , we have an event , a memory , an idea to rate , it comes on us .
my plea in you , you , you play with the images in your mind , they use the power of your element , and they give him every day <unk> that their lives , enrich themselves .
yes , the good afternoon .
thank you for the references .
if i on a party , asks me , what i like in my spare time doing , and telling me to come together with friends , <unk> <unk> and up , i see is shining eyes and in the head of my audience , and the <unk> of the dancing crowds , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> up .
if i then <unk> that it , the film festival in a film festival , classical music is , push and those dancing crowds of the old people , in now , long <unk> in <unk> of sit and very focused on the art , listen .
frank <unk> once said , about music to talk is so how about architecture to dance .
and so much more importantly , that with the what we do .
so they still a glimpse of getting about , i 'll talk , i you a short film with them .
a film .
there is <unk> <unk> <unk> it .
that 's my view , the question is the point .
since <unk> is that <unk> from the <unk> got out , something completely different to do .
we makers , are today , so forth between eighteen , and the middle , the end of two decades old , and have very early in our youth who experienced , which an enormous power and delight us , classical music <unk> .
we have , but also seen that the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> us there are joyful , well , a bit of what can .
and we are the , of belief that 's called the crisis the classical music , not the content , so the music , but at their <unk> is .
so we think about the question , how do we have a <unk> create the music , the near the friends and this force over again , there , so that we so , you 'd like .
how do we have a <unk> organizing , beyond the <unk> the <unk> work ?
we put the parameter that you from the classic concert will know , space , time , light , context , basically in the question .
we take for the relationship between the audience and musicians .
normally , there 's between the stage and the audience a gap .
we 're trying to the up .
here you a picture of our <unk> .
the musician , sitting in the audience , drink beer , entertain , in the breaks down with the audience , standing on to play a , two pieces , put the back in the audience .
this is the course at a little <unk> .
everybody , like it has <unk> , from the stage , and goes back .
or that 's sitting in the concert .
in the classic concert , it is that you on more or less comfortable , permanent , chairs , like you here , and after the front of look , and listening .
but there 's music , because you ca n't actually sit still .
and we thought i did , how can this will .
if you do n't sit and to a <unk> piece of music <unk> can , you are automatically way to .
still going to come to the concert does n't a stage was , but four stages the audience around .
the audience could , yes <unk> .
so , sitting at the night every once in the front row .
important for us is that we 're not only just any <unk> do , but that we of the music of thinking .
that we so questions that spaces and the atmospheres around , but also in the minds of the human needs the music that she 's so that can see how they are supposed to ?
and that then concerts by night to <unk> at 30 kilometers in <unk> , the s 's actually just one of <unk> lit up , in clubs , on <unk> , in the old <unk> .
but not just the spaces around , and the illumination can make music is going to and now , but the connection with other arts .
and so we are totally happy that we 've been a few years , <unk> work together to us dances , or movement to music to <unk> develop a , not actually the dance . wrote that was .
and that then <unk> for <unk> of beethoven , or for <unk> by steve get rich .
and in this year we 've got a , yes , that if you want to <unk> too .
we have the first time a concert and with a <unk> implemented .
we have the story from the soldiers of <unk> <unk> with actors , dancers , <unk> and just <unk> to a <unk> together .
that has all , and that works , because we have a <unk> had , in this piece which has .
we have a <unk> much money from people from all go back , so that we into could .
there is this film festival something that came from a community turned out of .
we 're totally happy , proximity of <unk> in the town in <unk> a home , and i have them .
the city is just as big that we think about spaces and exciting place for actually find , but also that small that we have to be .
if the beginning of the year in two weeks for <unk> from , europe in the city , then drops on just that the city , more people with <unk> around , usually .
the film festival is , volunteering that organized .
we makers , a colorful of students and students , and doctors , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , really , totally up .
and to a <unk> a <unk> <unk> that the <unk> or did , and funding in the eye you keep , <unk> , seven to 10 makers in a <unk> to the for a year so that you do is taking .
it , volunteering , but they care , for a year is that for the <unk> or the <unk> , the <unk> in , of hands are and to the film festival by going .
we do that all in our time , and live in all of germany and distributed .
i mean , the worst part of labor of production and on a <unk> .
just three times , we meet us about this year and distributed to a city weekend , we make , to talk about the , or other problems that popped up , and caring for this is also interpersonal together , just surface and it matters , if you do something like in motion to want .
for this even come and then two decades until about 30 volunteers , the first to the for a few days or a few weeks of their hands of being and there is where the help it 's going to the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> , the <unk> .
and of course , in these 14 days from the musicians this .
now , i 'm going to do we have anything else you for this is a film festival is it .
but our <unk> is that .
we have is in <unk> in the city 's a large community to us around the one of , supported in the what we want to do .
that goes from the classic <unk> go , and that goes , but also about very practical things like for the <unk> , because we have a baker , the us with the bread <unk> or a <unk> , we were fresh food to spend it .
that <unk> is in a <unk> in the city , over the year and sells .
to the <unk> .
we have in <unk> a whole series of individuals found , their living room to ask , with the musician , there is where we can .
and the way of this is this to enable in this city has and from the people in this city .
they identify , in a very particular way of with this film festival .
since the beginning of the year we began to thank <unk> support of the citizens of place a <unk> in a call that now the entire endeavor in a sustainable and reliable <unk> turns out .
we makers , from the stage , believe that classical music <unk> , provided you come in the right hands .
so we 're incredibly happy about that , europe , young musicians , music in your hand , and home in fact , in the cities <unk> hold .
if they 're still not that really can imagine , that feels , classical music , like to experience then they come , just over .
the next year we 're back in <unk> and we would be happy , if you , there are .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , learn .
you may know the proud .
you heard about this for learning or to the effect of learning , but i mean , to learn things are still much more , which is also <unk> <unk> <unk> collecting and <unk> win .
you know , with an experience of time <unk> , a formula for the <unk> .
what i of art and culture , i 've got , well , because i can not a lot of course to say , because now ar : bits <unk> i yes , in this field .
and so i thought that it may be really would , this is something <unk> called a different <unk> still going to give , what my talk <unk> .
art is beautiful , power , but much work .
they 've now , both laughed .
you get , the laughter , though most of the saying , you know .
why is that ?
i think that has to do with that in the word you something <unk> , what we 're not that really means we can .
art , that we say , sometimes , it 's what .
to work we say that often , it 's what .
sometimes it .
the people , like to work , it 's what for me .
but at work , we think rather , the <unk> and in the art , rather , the rich , beyond the everyday , where we 're in moving , our experience to collect , our own thoughts that .
and so i my life that i you now you want , in about three hours in five into a split , all the headline , with a i start to make it for you very simple .
it starts with the <unk> , for the childhood , goes on the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not all tell from my youth to do n't worry , then go further , the word <unk> i 'm later , why i think that for my <unk> actually have .
the interaction , for the first of my professional life and finally , five , positive identification .
intense one of you will this is these pieces of <unk> sebastian leave you know .
<unk> , two , and <unk> .
you learn them so in the first two , three years , if you were to practice , and i -- we practiced .
and so with 10 , 11 , i have little pieces and she said , the piano , not far from here , the <unk> , to home .
these pieces of life of a <unk> .
there 's a melody and she said , and the different voice <unk> , but it 's very differently .
the rhythm is right , but it 's <unk> .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , is something crucial in art that it succeeds , and if it only two , who are , <unk> together , together to think if that the present , the future , the past , sometimes is , works , images , in <unk> , in plays , things that <unk> are , the moment to bring together , the art makes me .
and i have , and learned , two distinct melodies , sometimes , three , in the <unk> <unk> , at to play , any kind but to hear that one to illustrate the other not .
so that was , what i because i 've got , under one .
a another experience , i 've never forget and i was the worry or so that 's me today may also like to be .
i piano <unk> , it was still more people in the room , here today , and in the <unk> i came out .
i did it .
i brought her .
so again , the start , and the same place , i did again , not on .
the audience has more and sweated , almost as i , because i went in all quiet on my place , i brought my notes , put them , and the third time the beginning .
and they do n't think , like the me <unk> 've got behind .
but that was a very immersive experience .
maybe that was also one of experiences , where i then you know , well with the piano , although i then quickly as a <unk> had , i should perhaps not my spent go here , because we talk , easier to cheat .
yes , the next the next chapter in my adolescence , yes <unk> with the inspiration and also because i want to tell stories .
when i then that <unk> was , i went to my <unk> and she told him , let me sir <unk> , i want to a <unk> play .
and he said , oliver , that 's not .
i mean , all kinds of coffee , going to have and very much experience with women raised all have .
now you imagine the time ago , a <unk> young man , so , young , like a sentence .
the i sort of course not forget .
and of , i sort of course , more adept at .
now i was the way too . '' and to time in a <unk> .
i practiced , and i remember , a situation that i like never more experienced what you have .
it was that <unk> of dress shoes of chopin , and now i 'm going to the part of work , i have a 'm just do n't control , and she was with the most beautiful place , as you had the poor do , and then went this together again , and back apart .
i could it now unfortunately , play , is not a piano , here , and i could it 's not anymore .
i have this place two decades , 30 times a row on and suddenly got them properly .
and then i did you keep playing and <unk> , i in a complete ecstasy and she said , and i just , that i suddenly the soil quit and laughing .
i was , except me .
i did n't finish , not taken , and the music has this with me doing this .
an experience , where i 've learned , emotions , really allow us .
and sometimes it 's also , to work that you 're in this had get , in this condition , i call it , the <unk> .
where everything from ourselves , it .
we had this situation , then in the <unk> <unk> in an organization .
there was then almost anything like by itself , when we the <unk> did , the only two months for , where you usually a half years , would need .
so , that were my experiences with the piano , with the art , with the artistic work .
and now i 'm going to my student , <unk> .
i was first , when musicians out , but just as <unk> .
we have <unk> said , <unk> , <unk> .
i <unk> given and have taught me because so , it next to my <unk> for the music and engage you can and that <unk> had .
in the choir singing , all breathe , a <unk> singing , wonderful experience that i was very , and one of infused into this .
and a point , where i as <unk> in the <unk> theater , in the <unk> went to me , in the <unk> and the overhead , and i do that 's why do with <unk> <unk> , this chapter , because there for me this idea came , this , this idea came , from this combination of art , culture , i was then , <unk> also just in the <unk> have , politics and law school , a job to do .
which is the art of culture to , to my <unk> to do .
so here to work for the art , but it 's not as artists , but , otherwise would you , not say <unk> , but rather than <unk> move forward and there are going to be done .
i was there in the theater and have taught me <unk> , it was in germany , no <unk> for <unk> , just in vienna , there , i did , and of , i 've always more with this question is too , what you can do anything to art to the framework for art to improve it to a management , a good number of building ?
and that was the reason , why i actually , on 'm in my professional , , this <unk> , <unk> years , i was yes , then <unk> .
but before that was a different <unk> , and this phase , yes <unk> with interactions .
<unk> i came to the germans <unk> .
the german <unk> has its <unk> in <unk> .
i 'm <unk> , though sometimes in my c.v , because i in <unk> born , and it says , the <unk> oliver <unk> , about my pet , i , i got this kind of time <unk> .
but i mean , a <unk> root , because my grandparents , maternal were also <unk> <unk> , and there , in <unk> , i have the <unk> experienced .
now , that i 'd like something that i 'm not as the privilege of have , and suddenly i was sucked in a different form of culture , in a <unk> , in a culture that lived by one of people in this in this <unk> device the <unk> .
once the <unk> on us was coming , were all in a very different situation , another situation .
and i 'm going to <unk> <unk> , the future <unk> and <unk> <unk> , my friend and colleague , because then we have always for the <unk> the music done , he 'd be , i piano , other has a bass , and she said , for example , i was at her <unk> .
we have the <unk> <unk> done , so , but of course , that the <unk> <unk> , for months , if you .
and this <unk> , that was really from the people out .
it was my destiny , the ninth november <unk> for my <unk> learned and i <unk> n't start with the wall fell .
i was the next day , i was oral exam , oh , the wall is like , yeah .
have taught me , fast on being prepared , on any questions for <unk> .
and go there was i <unk> for the cities in the east germany .
and i again , you know , interaction as social interactions are going on between two young german cultures .
actually speak , we did the same language , the music is there , wonderful and was wonderful and she said , but a lot was <unk> , <unk> .
different than the <unk> it was not the people all of yourself , but it was a lot of the top , and that i as a big lesson from it felt , here to experience as the german , as well , that i get after time , back to slow , very broken , and the german <unk> then these two states , connecting .
since is germany , yes <unk> .
since is also the federal much more <unk> placed .
interaction , i then , but of all things here we learned and i know , in the city of food .
we have of the first place that i had actually a <unk> , you imagine the time ago , when i 'm here 's started , <unk> , stood on my <unk> <unk> for culture and play .
i have the still .
and play catch up for <unk> , you do n't want to write <unk> for culture and <unk> .
i was looking at the first of the <unk> .
so i have time , not so much so , was that 's wonderful , these <unk> had , but they would soon , because i then for education in charge , and to make alliances , education , and they could .
we have very much for the urban design done , we have the if you only time that is an analog in between <unk> , <unk> and <unk> see , what that it be able to have to the <unk> experience , <unk> , where you interactions between works and architecture of it can , from <unk> to <unk> the blue rocks .
many , again , we were and i could create , and i experienced , and the time , what this , if different people from different areas and a target to track .
they memorize the way that i always more <unk> of the art , more and the culture , which , that <unk> between humans , between cultures , between those communities , better , in the view , and i come , but afterwards the art .
interaction , and then the <unk> the subject as we , <unk> , seven <unk> the idea was , the would be , january <unk> , that <unk> could , the <unk> europe for .
but this last chapter that is a fifth chapter one has yet the headline identification .
this word , yes , two primary meanings , for a , i either me with something , <unk> me so to something , and i put it , but also as verb , use and say , i either something that means , i know something .
and that 's always in his <unk> .
i know something with his <unk> , so i say , i either you , or the or that community .
and i either me with something , when i 'm trying to <unk> and say , that you wanted to me , i want to identify .
and that 's a very big action .
five had three million people to try to move , <unk> cities , identify the double the sense , to <unk> and to realize that you a community is in europe .
as big , we have it then <unk> called , but anyway , as a community of many people that in a big farmland , life and yet at least a common language to talk , <unk> nations are here and this was our frontier of identification , to the people and of course , too much a ride .
in the signs of <unk> the highway , many other experiences .
an experience of the <unk> . i have not so many people around .
so ham , <unk> <unk> and eat , two schools , worked , young girl from <unk> that <unk> , and boy , students from a <unk> school , from <unk> <unk> , letters of people , young men , from <unk> to play the data , the home , say goodbye , love , death , the last letter writing .
and it was already a special effect that young girl letters from young <unk> up and boy , the russians and using letters from young men from germany in a <unk> german .
and there sits down , one of these young men , in the piano , and this <unk> that i was so loved .
and , oh , who he from a letter , and said , i 'm <unk> , he wrote him to home , as a german , he was , and i ca n't even more a <unk> , because my my two fingers on <unk> are .
and he <unk> his finger and a <unk> , sat down , again , in the piano in this play on <unk> carl , and trying to the <unk> to play .
and it managed to do n't .
it was for me like a <unk> scene , they said , in front off 'm , i said , what we actually have learned ?
we 've learned , in the <unk> that many people together to move to , but of all things we 've learned that we sixties , in <unk> in peace of life and the culture that connects to us , the minds go , because we different languages to talk to us to identify , to us , inside ourselves feel .
and that was for me a wonderful experience and you see , it goes to learn not just about , something to know .
it goes to learn , so , something to learn and <unk> .
and if we 're much up and invention , let this , <unk> , if we it does n't tolerate that we inspire and let of art and culture , our own right position to relate , in dialogue with the artwork , if we interact and finally , at our own identity and tried to work , by we interact with art and culture and ask , let me , then we all have won .
and i hope that they still many <unk> and <unk> , from where they are those profit to .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i think , we wait on the first picture that matter .
so i have to <unk> to support my memory . here 's a few slides <unk> .
it , but no scientific slides , but it goes in my <unk> here 's a direction to find and me with a subject of the way through , where i think that 's going to the next few years very significant implications are .
by the <unk> words , i know now finally , thank you that , what ted 's also means , and i think , in <unk> we can this talk is quite arbitrary .
and then i still have heard that you 're going to talk , in english to be , if it possible , but , if you look at it , then you see , they would n't understand what to in english to say , i was not directly , i do it to say , and so , what i talk , then , but the german , calm .
how we will die .
i have to them because the first of <unk> tell .
<unk> was a patient in the hospital , i the <unk> <unk> , and was down .
she was about <unk> , and has always like the may , dance , because it 's also , her husband is reminded , the first man that in war by it was then .
and this is , every year for the first , may be able to dance , you go and has been a dance and probably even then a <unk> <unk> of drinking , and then is down and , , here on the right side you see this , the leg broken , the <unk> .
a few years earlier , she also , even slow down and i had the same way , with equal occasion , , even the left leg is broken .
and i was also been there as a doctor and have experienced , weeks of the intensive care would say , with the antibiotics in mind , they also been , and have the discussion around , as i was , is because that sense ?
it makes no sense , held in this old people like this intense , it is to use to ?
so really is , to <unk> , the intensive care for weeks , like this is a people at all <unk> ?
and she 's and cured .
five years later i take the clinic , i see the name <unk> , and the i can all know , because he just so rare is , indeed , the time and then , and , the dance in may be back the other one leg is broken .
it turns the question , what <unk> i there 's actually , when i talk about , as a person , to decide to , what he was in his directives write , or what he also , <unk> which ?
and this kind of the theme of the presentation .
you see here , then the <unk> the called , how we will die .
it 's a book out of <unk> , how we 're going to a report on the <unk>
and then it was so that the globalization are very ahead was that so , asking , how can , go , connected to work ?
this , then , and it is in this book also now , you read , just said , it 's a quality to come together so the parts always fit .
it 's a -- the work in front , it will also the work , a lot more you 're going , for example , after china , but that was a big issue .
and that 's actually , so come to basically the work , the individual , so something to assemble , something to paint , less , ending , that he always more control , of the quality , he <unk> , of the accuracy .
and that , after my prior assessment , the people 's less and confidence from their work to be able and more and part of a little <unk> were , where it 's about , as height of <unk> to reach , and , so , through his work , to define .
and if we this now that into the <unk> and medical domain of , then there 's course , that one development .
if you the tv , to hear about the doctors , nurses and also <unk> the most not find them , you 're 's the so-called <unk> .
and that means nothing else , when there must have documented , what you has done , so it <unk> is going to make it even paid is , and if not going to document is , and says the health service 's also , that care or that medical treatment for we do n't .
and through these ones with , but the work <unk> always more <unk> and more and is approaching this idea that you his work too , and with the use of personal belief compound , the background , like a <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> .
a good friend of me is now , the netherlands , you go , because he showed this , they wanted to the had a <unk> practice , the given up and is after the netherlands , you go to the doctor for <unk> to be .
the <unk> are in these software development , usually a piece of forward and he , martin , had just experienced that are more and old people swing between the nursing , the hospital , to and back , because the <unk> , you know , what they should do if it 's the people , went .
then come into the hospital , will have restored to go back in my senior home , or a nursing , and be there on those .
and this family , did that i thought , if it that 's structured them in holland , there , i want to be there 'd like train just to stand here to promote that you out of this cycle of the <unk> and the also <unk> <unk> of people <unk> can .
there , in holland , which had he however , after he the language with a lot of that i 've had learned that there , the same thing happens , what the <unk> happened was .
it will also trying to die of a quality in place .
it is , the credibility that counts , but you put even in a very solid , i want for example , not be , or not the hospital , when i in a nursing 'm .
and then they do that <unk> .
in holland , it 's so , the third of days , finds a conversation with the <unk> instead , and they have to then , an issue , i want to the hospital or i want , the hospital , when i do something happens .
so just with the , i want to be or i do n't want to be .
this data , then , a central and there is this type of <unk> , has always the <unk> ago , and so then the decision on that basis .
if we now , <unk> back , yes , like the may , dance , and even slow down , and we imagine that have some of directives wrote , i want to do n't be , if you that the dance in may have may , then back down is , admittedly , and , you see that we can .
and that has been my friend now , there in holland -- is , also very much <unk> , he with us to .
in the past it 's so that <unk> is about their sixties , until seventy percent of people , to home to die , but in hospitals , institutions , and that these institutions that 's , so you do that as well , not the ideals of habitats these are for the old people , but it 's often , we do we <unk> scope , the <unk> are often <unk> and the funding , and for , this <unk> find there , after my sense , just constrained by instead .
there 's about who are the very good about , there 's very <unk> people that , there are , but if i the <unk> at , and we have about <unk> patients in the year , so roughly five , six , perhaps from <unk> to us so , then i would for me say , it is hard , there classes and be inside the self-esteem , unsustainable .
this has course <unk> reasons , this is very clear , this whole quality , those of it 's why we introduced , because the last the money for it 's not enough to all people that can and in the way of those are and that people , the care for good , or the medical center who wants to be paid you to say , there was -- i well , right , because i can for example , as a nurse a family of feed , or two children .
this is simply not the fact , but you need two salaries , in <unk> and <unk> and mostly it , just below .
this introduction of the quality , of constantly up the market , you bring governance to work , so , on the individuals have .
and now i 'm going to how to the maybe we can escape , so what do we now in the past , because i yes , first of questions asked , and this , so very simple is the situation , there 's not .
and i simply let 's <unk> <unk> and the articles on one of me , there <unk> , because i think , a society that it would always like this structure , and legal structure , which we also , <unk> , what happens in our society .
and in <unk> was one is just that would the people 's <unk> .
and the second set up there is , you to protect it 's top of task of <unk> .
and what i sometimes it 's missing , is still a third set in there , which every one , the assignment should have to be able to protect and to defend themselves .
because that a way is themselves , to be free from this case , i give it 's another way , and to me a kind so , and feed , and then i need that i was looking at least not thinking about doing , i because even die .
because the past , it is yes , so , we this subject does n't like to ask , we are some of the point .
hopefully , first time , with a century or <unk> .
the equivalent of course of my career as well , to say , that wish i each and i want , about , but some point is , this subject to face , and if it then maybe so far is , or as well , if you <unk> , <unk> or <unk> is , it already late in life to be late in life be to say , i 'm talking about this question now , thinking .
if you now think about , what does mean i 'd like , then you 're going on the results come , then the last out , what are because the five of things in my life has gone ?
there 's now a book , what 's pretty en <unk> is .
it are the self-esteem of course , it , then the friends , i , with that i go and exchange can , i know , and the me through the living with , it are the <unk> .
it 's sure that trust between humans , which i may also related to have , in <unk> or in the actual area or a pastor or a <unk> or you with other people , which i in the relationship , learn .
and it there are all kinds of one of course , there <unk> , i leave the right now , not all through .

and then come then , another factor that point that 's a dictatorship in the <unk> experience , i did this of times as a text , or as well , as an example of that took .
other people can for us these decisions and this behavior , there <unk> , not meet .
this is my inner conviction .
we would be up of us to come out .
so it 's not the question , what are because others to me to do , who 's going to me , power , for babies , or , for me , in fact , who goes on me to be ?
but it 's exactly the other way , to ask , where i can on people want , where you can i put myself and by my inner would die of that i do with these questions that can and i 've got the position and make it .
and if you and says , how we 're going , so that inside this quality of us , put it was , it 's a way , to say , how i me about my my inner would , this mechanism to get away .
because no man can tell me at , i find ourselves , because you see , and position to .
and i must be there 's also do n't fit into in general <unk> or out to say , you 've got to a directives out and because you been so old , me , kind of you , if you be want to see if you on an icu want .
these questions , i can be in the last only after a long <unk> probably <unk> frontier .
this was the people 's one of posture , in me is , and the not , though they can be that the state , not protecting it , as a law , not , and the me , people <unk> can and i 'd rather <unk> , when i just there myself before , which we asked myself 've got so the also know , what i for a person 's me .
and to those conversations to lead , it 's spaces , and i think , and so i have this talk about this is called , and here , for , are those spaces like that <unk> in the food , that i you here two things tried , on a picture times <unk> , spaces , where we over these topics are thinking to , where a more confident that room , so it does n't hurt this is that 's also may not to theory is , but that even a conversation . there 's happening .
so we , if we then the old , it can say , oh yeah , like a dance in may , despite my may very high ages , that would , what .
i thank you very much for your attention .
beautiful good evening .
i 'm two things with .
if you the first part to go , is , and a little <unk>
it 's still a second .
we start with the infinite .
that 's stupid , not , can take you .
what you mean ?
there 's different <unk> ?
or is forever enough ?
yes !
that 's not , this one of it is , what 's looking !
so , in fact , but i 'll it , for the that you know it .
and that we do n't .
we engage us with just one .
and i frontier that would like a little too . '' for a finite planet .
<unk> , finite , we know , are beginning to form , we need to know .
and it 's searching for the <unk> the magnitude of them .
if we in a finite way , and if you just two <unk> , in a for example , chairs , in the other people .
we know , , now , we need to look in the box in the number is small , it are three , chairs and it are three people .
we can we will , in lots of the same amount of elements in it 's ?
count , how would we do it ?
i mean , we would just the people <unk> , one , two , three , we get the three , we count the chairs , see three , chairs , one , two , three , three and three three is three , and wonderful .
that you mean , yeah ?
very good .
this works in a finite wonderful , it 's also in large numbers , though it sucks .
but it .
how do you still had that ?
how can still going to check that so many people like the chairs , there are ?
i realized , chairs and people , and not what else .
<unk> let me !
it 's called mate .
you very well , that it 's obvious , not , we 're now the ground on , and understand that all !
not something that 's very nice .
so , it 's called too advanced a <unk> and it works as well , yeah ?
you take a , of them on a chair , from the mouse .
the next <unk> , way , the next <unk> , everything is to them , different people get different , chairs , not a chair is abandoned and the amount of these are the same size , okay ?
now we go into the infinity .
how do we have two infinite amount of each other 's conceivable ?
we 'd say , the one is that big or more or smaller than the other .
we could we do it ?
we would be back to .
alright , it 's wrong , because the point is the , if you in an infinite number for a lot to start to count , i 'd let 's just say , they do n't come to another .
<unk> , forever , is clear , <unk> ?
so , which is how it ?
madame ?
no way , madame !
they had this is it 's really started .
they mate .
so , now we look at the time .
and guess , we estimate is in an always bad , yeah ?
you see , you see , no end , yeah ?
the point is what , you make it very simple .
if i for the <unk> take , those numbers , <unk> , we computer scientist who need to zero in the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five .
and we have to say , , a copy of this <unk> and take from a piece of the infinity in many <unk> pay a way .
and there is staying the just numbers , okay , zero , two , four , six , eight , <unk> ?
okay ?
all straight numbers are <unk> the infinite number of a long , the natural numbers , but on a band n't have the <unk> , the other people are the line , and the <unk> on , okay ?
we call the a lot , g , straight to pay , we call the other kinds of n , the natural numbers .
do you know ?
this is , g powerful , it 's bigger than n , the same or smaller ?
the same ?
but this is really have done , yes , a missing , the <unk> .
who have a different estimate . '' ?
smaller ?
who says , bigger ?
ah , the , yes , really do n't plan , yeah ?
this ca : yes , not be , yeah ?
you ca : well , not , what 's missing , bigger , that 's not , <unk> ?
okay , they say , smaller ?
you 'd assume , not ?
this is the conventional wisdom , what you suspected , is wrong .
and now , and now i 'm , why the amount of the same .
and how does it ?
right .
yes , we mate .
this is the point .
we mate .
we take the zero from the line of , we take the zero from the natural lot , mate , out .
the next one of zero , plus two of it 's two , after the next to get the one , and i 'll get back a <unk> .
the four , the two , the six , the three , eight , the four , yeah ?
you can that 's also turn , it 's doubling , it 's obvious , <unk> ?
and it 's clear , through the <unk> we do it that i do it always in the lecture that 's a <unk> <unk> .
and this one , there are just the straight on the band is a long , yeah ?
we <unk> the natural on the straight , <unk> , the <unk> are the way , and the band is still in a long .
that 's just in the infinite .
so if you any chance to explain what we have today i learned to have the infinity learned , which is because it forever , i know , just finally ?
an infinite amount of has a property that 's in a finite 's not and this is , is absolute <unk> , a real subset of this is how large is .
do that they in a finite not , if you from three three people are two people <unk> , it 's only still a there and that they were about three .
yes , so we 've infinity .
it 's none of links ?
okay .
then do we still a second part , the odds .
the professionals , -- the odds .
i did this is what brought .
in this experiment , i 'm sure , it 's at least a third know , and <unk> it does anybody with , on , yeah ?
so , we call the doors , a boca , b , c .
i think there 's something hidden , i hope that they have it 's not heard .
and they should now why do n't guess .
where , you mean , i have something hidden , behind a boca , b , or c ?
guess , here , our <unk> , here .
you appreciate the c .
who still has one another idea ?
a ?
who still has an idea ?
i 'm going to <unk> , b has been missing , not , you 'll hear the yes , never , <unk> ?
that 's right .
it 's really all but anyway , so they have to do n't mean , the three of letters to fall and i 'm looking for me one .
it 's really matter , yeah ?
it is yes , completely clear , because the chance that it has always have been , is yes , it has only in a third .
<unk> , there 's three things , it 's really matter , yeah ?
now i am here , i 'm just one on .
well , i of course , where it 's .
<unk> , that , anybody here , <unk> .
so , i know , where it 's , and the best guess , and appreciate that , or how do anything that you do it 's called , goes in a second round .
so i 'm now , the game explain what i now it now , <unk> .
so it 's so , we go in a second round .
now , , i <unk> me on this a , <unk> ?
so , now i have to a door to show up behind the it 's and that they do n't have said .
because , if you now , b to say , and i say , and i know , it is yes , not the b .
then there 's yes , a second round .
then i say , <unk> , from the mouse , she got a little better .
but i must , that 's <unk> , in the second round and go .
so i can just an open , behind the 's not only is , but what they also do n't have said .
now is the question , and this is the -- the odds , under the condition 's remained , under the condition , b is open is , and it is , you have now your last chance , to guess .
they must now in a boca , then i do is necessarily a , on .
i 'm now this on , what they want to have .
or they say , i 'm a c .
now is the <unk> , it 's now with this knowledge likely to become ?
phew , very beautiful , b is on , now i know , it 's behind , c .
or , but , god is , thanks to b , you have been is , i always wanted to a boca , this is it .
or would you 're saying , is , <unk> , we have , <unk> , way , we 've only still two doors , now it 's no matter , to change , or to stay .
what you mean ?
it 's not matter .
<unk> .
why is it does n't matter ?
very good .
why it 's why is it <unk> ?
yes , yes , it 's wrong .
this seems yes , almost , as if we it yesterday <unk> have , <unk> ?
but that are you , <unk> , are a new , no fun .
so , here , it 's very <unk> , yeah .
that get all sorts between , i 'm not , six and , i ca n't sixties years , you can i 'll , as well , <unk> ?
so , it get really , everybody .
behind this door is it to a third .
and it 's always just to a third of a door .
you can guess , what they want , they have with two thirds of them in the dirt .
that would you can on two doors to guess it , it is yes , in <unk> do , you ca : yes , two dozen put them , you 're it , <unk> , the zero , we transferred that 's real , everything in real life .
but here we 've just a door .
so , is now , here , two thirds of it 's not , what you guess .
so what 's the two thirds of here , but it 's just behind a door of !
behind the is it !
so , which is then more likely ?
no way , , that 's really quite hidden .
so , which is now more likely ?
it 's better , to stick , or to change ?
now it 's easy , yeah ?
yes , clearly !
so that , now not hard , <unk> ?
ha !
what we see ?
they 've got a little better .
why ?
basically , and two thirds are not a hundred percent , the difference between the theory and practice .
i hope that it was to everybody what that .
thank you .
mr. <unk> you to me , jamie oliver <unk> , here in front of this is no diet and bad food and overweight people coming , this depressed , yes , completely .
but i whistle , my best that after all the way is that has some insights .
i come , which of <unk> farm and i knew i went to 12 was n't mcdonald 's .
that time , who , yes .
yeah .
thank you for the references you today .
i 'm here in the close up .
and i do n't know , mr. <unk> , so on it came to me to ask , if i the ted , the seas as well i want , and over a particular topic to talk .
i told me <unk> <unk> : the theme of trust .
it , motivation is also not bad and i <unk> me the woman <unk> , that has said , maybe the power of a or another , later , sports .
if only i also full of that have them .
so today , tonight about the rain , jogging to be now <unk> lot of them , but i have to make tomorrow , training , because i in three weeks , the <unk> june , <unk> , of <unk> to oslo to do with 'm a bike , that are <unk> miles .
so i left the morning , the rain this training do n't get freed up .
so you ride to <unk> , go tomorrow , early on , in <unk> , i one , they all welcome .
i ' been already said , briefly , i <unk> ' <unk> the issue of trust .
and i was , starting to do , based on <unk> .
do n't worry , the nice , little <unk> , the blind faith to come up afterwards <unk> .
i , before me just thought about it did , when i <unk> 'm going to describe what i would be the where i <unk> ?
so , i come from 'm a village with six houses , you <unk> , some <unk> and in my parents lying on the farm there 's one apple , <unk> and <unk> -- and what , you make <unk> , and beer .
trust , in sports , of course not in <unk> but with me , <unk> and beer .
why use , i the story , from where i ?
for me is one of the very important stories that i really that right from the country , the village , come , and there was raised me with two big brothers , with the oldest brother , the <unk> is .
and do with the brother , the same word is how i .
i mean , and see the light and dark , it as i 'll also see , where <unk> window in space , whether it 's light , is , or from .
what is very convenient is for the <unk> .
the , we both can actually see , if of us anything .
'n pole , but i say , and i ca n't tell , is <unk> man <unk> pole .
the to talk about the old men , <unk> .
and to go <unk> .
and what for me , but , it was critical , is obviously , the fact , so you trust and you 'll just this great confidence that <unk> that we all need to <unk> as something <unk> situation , say , i time .
and that was for my parents definitely , that you how many of them , of my brother and i actually , not known .
we were so the first , then , which suddenly , in their lives <unk> are .
and then they had to the situation of what do .
and , now <unk> i , it 's a giant fortunate that my parents than farmers are not all the day long time had to us to stand and us from the hand to move or to say , there 's <unk> wall , there <unk> you , along and you can , then <unk> feel , where you <unk> .
a , that would be awkward been -- we 've got home so <unk> .
and b , ham , our parents of the beginning of us to them , we are going to go , where we also our sighted brother is .
so , in the home alone <unk> , the <unk> down and <unk> , it also a risk .
there 's the blind brother , i 'm going to 'm <unk> <unk> mean by , <unk> used in .
the order to the order to i have to this is still .
this is with the big brothers -- that are not only good for the elbow , but also for the <unk> .
and our brother and and my brothers and i we ham , i 'm a courtyard of that all the outside did , ma , you could do , for bicycle , drive .
and that has the <unk> brother and excitement , starting with three years , and then we were obviously also -- michael and i .
and , then started , with <unk> to go down , in many little kids , today with the wheel is that <unk> <unk> <unk> .
until the <unk> that can .
but we have that , starting with <unk> , no .
and then is the big question : how to get hit on behalf , there ?
and how do you get that trust , one that trust the parents , the children , eventually brought back from the bicycle of light and <unk> and other thing that trust of us that we 're not permanently , where this to drive .
and our solution was that we obviously a , of our parents tell us have to , the <unk> , so where there is a car , where <unk> followers , may also a very unfamiliar that stuff , their homes -- that is , you 're not the way -- because we knew , so they are .
and we had in choosing , let 's one remember , but the other hand , listen .
and that you can now , in here , not all of testing , because you will it 's so according to you do n't , and more of them .
but <unk> , evening when they let 's light switch off , in their bedrooms , or , whose bedrooms and then they orient to .
you can time trying to just <unk> <unk> with the tongue , so , to orient and you 'll notice that 's in us humans as in the bats are also -- they 're a resistance .
so how the bats that with <unk> will also that you 're now <unk> wall , <unk> resistance , because the sound of different <unk> will .
and this is for me in trust , so trust , in the movement , very important .
but <unk> as high <unk> to have and the safety , i ' <unk> chance to me because <unk> piece to help .
and i just to believe is no big trouble and i realized , as well , many accidents , the one or other , there 's course , .
what i 'm going to say no pictures , i did , that i very <unk> itself is , one of our <unk> , as children .
which is the climb on our higher building on ♫ i 'm a courtyard .
i , here 's written , the confidence , it also by a <unk> diversity .
and that my goodness ' i 've been very literally , because i am a man , much too much later in <unk> and in the <unk> with confidence in the scientific side of busy . i , i 'm talking about one ever saying yes , or i never that stumbled out how i do it yourself , i 've gone .
i did , the never been so you may also be when i read .
now , but when you are also to do with that 's clearly not everybody 's exactly as an experience .
and diversity is the figure out of our strengths with this is announcing to some point to know where i a good , what i talent and where you can i mean , has really too full <unk> ?
and our brother 's again , the , michael and i 've always took on top of the house .
so , then , okay , we ham 's a <unk> .
because you come from somewhere i 'm a window <unk> of the <unk> for example .
and the johannes and then peel away , michael afterwards , and i was , probably already , i still <unk> bit like this girl playing , <unk> <unk> , i 'm not .
but in the end , who is like the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i think , the others , we 're yes , the next generation of young women , here , also not .
and of so i 'm , and yet , with .
and then was , the consequence that we will look at all three <unk> <unk> up there were and the dad , i 'm used to 'm <unk> <unk> and do n't even more you know , what he now , to say .
because that goes , then , when others to rule .
if the father so , to god will to help to help to help , if only , the risk of relative size and that one of us too afraid to get , and in <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- i 'm not -- somehow <unk> would be .
it is , but never happened .
he had to then , so <unk> that it 's just said , again , <unk> , or by johannes <unk> , the us , then returned .
and that was , i for me very great point that these opportunities .
but it , do n't worry that 's no value proposition , not necessary to later <unk> to do .
for me were the different kinds of sports , in my life and more important were , all , yes , interesting .
and so , they were all this <unk> , because i 'll also could see , where i ' i was so my borders , what are perhaps , so my gifts .
so to <unk> good <unk> i 've never going to .
that i had never the <unk> .
and i go , to do n't like in <unk> .
i go , to get out in the rain .
now , not in five degrees , like the moment .
and in <unk> rain , but rather than the current .
but i ' , for me so this faith in my strengths with found that i of sports tried to have .
as the first for example <unk> .
and that was for me very beautiful , because there 's also the coach , the us in <unk> had , has said , ok , we have a noisy <unk> children , but they send ' us <unk> of blind children .
actually stand . yeah well , because there pack , anyway , becomes the coats .
and then you notice , what the other people power .
and there was always been so my big trust , of course , when i the competition for many of making it 's hard , because then you can the other perhaps , but let 's what do , what i do n't <unk> .
so there 's just a way , and this is the faith in my initial speed .
the other into a foot in the <unk> imagine , i find yourself backwards fall so , the <unk> head that 's , and then it 's sitting in the back and the competition is over , because it 's the full score , there .
i 'll figure it 's not try it .
i did it i thought , but <unk> .
i think , this is now <unk> some miracles .
and i 've also now here 's not a volunteer , right ?
<unk> .
shit , i <unk> ' already .
okay .
the next for me that was a sports school in just then the <unk> and just <unk> .
my parents were home or are to <unk> and that they have , we also have taught me as children .
but for me was always in the school , it matters : how can i as much as well , the school to move to my excess energy out ?
and i then a way to school in <unk> to do .
and although i actually always thought , that 's all so , <unk> boring , because <unk> is something for the <unk> rather , <unk> ' i .
i found , i used -- <unk> ' i now not anymore .
i then eventually , well , i do with the <unk> .
and i did , then you find them , man , again , is the great diversity here in the sport , because you condition , needs , you need power , ai n't good did , and it <unk> extreme <unk> .
<unk> -- you may have a lot also of their work recognized ?
this is what 's also in <unk> .
you will only then quickly , if you just that you have faith in the your technology .
if you that confidence in the own power has -- so the force that you that 's also , then , every other conditions , the bad weather , the yield the snow , the <unk> snow , the ; they can .
and if you in my case you know , faith in the team has .
because when <unk> that do n't see , i mean , to <unk> <unk> .
and i still is never give <unk> happens like today -- i have to the word to use -- my <unk> -- there 's `` yes , just one -- has already today , my exercise .
it , but nothing , we do you yet again .
specifically , i <unk> , you now maybe just time .
do with a , one , one of you later still a different exercise .
what i find is always do the subject of the blind faith , is the exercise to the listener , just imagine making such as it 's so , if you do n't see that <unk> , and with its <unk> <unk> .
the <unk> <unk> yes , so , you have two sticks in my hand .
and therefore , right , i ' i do n't hand anymore , otherwise , i could yes , my goodness ' <unk> take and i have the <unk> feel them .
n't do .
so i have to me different helping .
i then my <unk> and the front of me running .
and the told me with the voice , the way .
so the to just always the exact <unk> do .
and also that 's important for trust .
the precision of communication , so in the <unk> .
and the <unk> tell me just always <unk> , if it <unk> goes , tell me <unk> and <unk> , the says , then , left , 11 , i know it 's easy to left , so the upper part of technology at the pointer .
when he says , left on top 10 little sharper left , and when he says , right on a decade .
okay , all understand ?
then <unk> <unk> problem , because then i have to go back and or he had to me , i think again , i know , , now is what do n't .
and for me is yes , big , critical , if the <unk> ago i 'm going , i have to the really completely <unk> to a 's a negative to say .
the janitor 's positive way to say , he 's for me that tool that 's me to , just really , and then quickly to be and in <unk> too much faster than others , in the competition to start .
and that i can only , when i am i just do , with both arms to me <unk> , i <unk> , on a leg , to stand and i need to really the eyes to make -- ha ha , or they can also open to make , to `` yes , nothing .
and to be like this <unk> and to then on the other one leg and much again , and you can not here <unk> bit in further , but to actually can go stand .
also with high shoes .
yes , and this is for me , critical , when i the <unk> 'm just imagine : how <unk> i do it , the guy to say , so i 'm a guy , because i actually just men as <unk> had to do i 's the just to say , hey , you got me the right <unk> do , because the right , it : yeah , ourselves .
the know , not , what he told me to say .
so i 'm one of him the way to communicate , just open to .
and that 's like in any <unk> .
if anyone in my needs n't know , he can i mean , i do n't help , but there i just wondered , and to say : well , i need , of you the rate , maybe <unk> <unk> used to be socializing them .
or i need , of you like now , walking to her to me just as well , says , how long , the mountain , is , because if we the <unk> <unk> , because you think , some time : now to it 's over time .
and kick in again in , like nuts and that thing it on .
and practice , i then we 've also time the pilot , as a 's the walking is , i 'm <unk> forward , the me and says , we have unfortunately only 20 minutes , behind us , because we may -- so we ham the other times <unk> minutes , it -- then , it , but again , rather <unk> .
of why is that for me already , there 's also the , accurate <unk> have them .
i 'm like , <unk> -- here 's probably another , also <unk> <unk> driving ?
who is more ?
so my best thing was time , times faster , but that was in september , and so in april , may i am i honestly , i still never been so much faster on how thirty-six minute .
and in the forecast the moment , <unk> .
and for me , again , it 's that we got <unk> only then as possible , when i mean your ears , i did .
the other me just as well , exactly explain , what he comes to the eye sees me and so the way there , my risk of all estimate .

so , ' sake of a blind , not so much , i said -- from <unk> .
because i also been the experience we had to me a <unk> right , and left to be socializing them had .
and then was in the competition and at the bad , because it 's next to the way across three feet <unk> .
and i am the three feet just <unk> .
and so -- again , but that was -- of course <unk> on .
that i know , because the <unk> to yes , around , to so <unk> <unk> .
and i think about it happening today still be permanently , i people say , left and say , then , <unk> , the other left .
so i was then , right , unfortunately .
does the ground , often not so much .
but it , in <unk> situation with pressure , that you probably also all of the work or the university , like that if it 's very quickly go to .
then is , precision , yes <unk> <unk> hard challenge .
but for me , again , it 's the blind faith that , that i the risk of trying to .
and i must be honest , say , i am more than anyone , not see , relative size of the advantage , because i <unk> ' i took risks in many ways .
so the <unk> <unk> ' i now so , all .
the driving <unk> tree , from the slope , down <unk> that you know , and i <unk> , but of course , and this is yes , that important -- i <unk> ' , the good news sites .
the fact , then also be done can , if that trust that there is .
and if you who has found that 's actually also a hundred percent , so <unk> , i am i just need .
and so i do so , and the same carbon targets . i .
because this is for me in the subject of trust me just the next , very key .
you need the goal and i have to leave you actually also clear , which is , really , trust , go ?
because of this is often <unk> more quickly realized that you let 's land .
i have the or the or i 'm asking yourself .
but it 's really is yes , that in too much depend on .
that you for that you for trust a lot <unk> .
and that you yes , -- because we are all with <unk> <unk> got out -- we want <unk> sense to see .
and the sense , is quite often that 's also create , 'n goal together to achieve .
that we do it -- in my case for example -- from some , weeks . i ' i am i the <unk> gone .
and there <unk> ' i just , i have to me now , who seek out , or the i put in the case that can count that i just this mountain , up that i get .
and how do you , then that you the bell mountain , some really up there 's right ?
well , i had course , on the advantage , i , some things right now we did n't see , if it for example , next to me a hundred meters <unk> .
then i was the relatively unknown .
ca <unk> advantage to be , it 's kind of heights , which is no problem .
and i ' , and around the heights worked , regardless of the <unk> i go and to time , i ' i then did something <unk> <unk> or i 'm in berlin <unk> flew , there will you with <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> .
that 's <unk> bit <unk> , then up there is , and down the cars by listening to you still not a lot to see how to there to know , now , do it hurts , when i <unk> .
and these things are for me and more interesting .
it to also the <unk> to have , but to just as to know , hey , i war , the , i there are so yes , focus , <unk> and can just by but also got a new experience .
and that <unk> <unk> bit of the <unk> , because in <unk> mountain <unk> yes , so , you go every day , 10 hours ago , to and it 's some just hold still get
you go and goes and has only still , stone tool in the room , less and plants .
you take the <unk> <unk> with , <unk> gun of years ago , i 'm the first world war and it .
so if you <unk> <unk> see , is the <unk> about the last the <unk> .
the only then so that the only an exciting .
we have the <unk> up of the distance , or the other one you .
and therefore <unk> ' i there <unk> a faith in the <unk> -- despite his silly <unk> that he and i had .
because i thought i ' : well , so , as i said , because <unk> ' i probably going faster , how to the thing , charging .
but , it 's otherwise very <unk> , because you , to <unk> actually now not that 's a lot of change .
and really exciting is that 's and then , yes , and so hard to .
so if you then in the go and the air to be thinner .
or if it 's next one off , then <unk> little <unk> , where 's left and the right off .
it 's particularly beautiful and if it 's actually , still accounting night is , and all with <unk> <unk> , then at us the <unk> , sometimes , specifically , now would he told me to be able to the wire , so he then i was also really in the view , and the grip .
because i the only without <unk> there <unk> and that was him , but sometimes to be risky .
trust , we have it is that i just said i did : well , i can course , she is , my friend , and was a hundred percent of trust , i <unk> ' , and we have that before , <unk> .
but i need , also <unk> form of security , so i 'm not permanently , focus to , because , you can imagine , if you the bell mountain , always say <unk> stone , right to focus on one , left , 11 .
there will you some <unk> , all .
so for us is confidence in the case was , we 're <unk> connection , so ham , a rope , your backpack attached that i had in my hand , and i 'm then behind her in which loosely <unk> rope has gone .
i had in the other <unk> <unk> , they said , so <unk> bit , the the stairs was when i did .
and she 's then eventually , only still , with the foot <unk> stone had or , with their <unk> <unk> rock on that i 'll also have already know , so on me ask , and i 'm not permanently , just focus had .
and what i was the men 's really has shown , how beautiful it 's actually , you kind of course , i realized then eventually , because the top of approaching , that you just this goal really so again in consistency , has -- just like , the <unk> , with the <unk> .
other hand , but it 's also that i was when i did , that trust me to come in me . i , that is , those who just because , now if i really <unk> goal was , like that the top .
but that trust is also in other , the <unk> , like trusting that works .
when we then at night of the mountain <unk> are , we were in the group , usually very ahead and behind us are the other seven people walked and that were always kind of dense behind us and it has been , every moment was somebody else behind us and i 've been thinking : tell ' time , why do that because why this because , everybody that he 's behind us can run ?
at night beside you also the girls not from behind you look .
this is somehow not the apparently .
and then i ' i eventually the time , oh yeah , ok , their faith in their skills that 's been also some pretty <unk> .
you go there at night by the dark , you about 12 watch off , then why do n't no light .
this is totally defy , if you <unk> is , the air is being thin , so just really , defy gravity and now , <unk> first place .
and then , but eventually , so the moment , where the , have said : yeah , man , that was really totally , behind you to go , because the friend of me , i just looked at all explained , we 've always <unk> -- like that women , so do .
have all the night of us anything , and the other in the group had the right there 's also like the recognition , <unk> to know , ok , it 's now just <unk> hour , that it hit me then told .
or i quit her what 's very different now , not from a story .
that to me to know , it 's still turn up there , it may also just lousy about <unk> about what we may time talking about -- it are only still <unk> hour , the sun 's going on .
what these things , also have this open-heartedness , can trust , significantly increase and it 's going to contribute to you so the personal medal but just as well done .
and for me is trust , then given , and it 's all , then the perfect , if you just like the personal medal and that , what 's really do n't want , then eventually , in the idea of the right there is .
this is course , in in sports , with the gold , in that you so <unk> -- i actually also not , why is an do -- maybe , i 'm not to the value to test , or to look , whether it 's just to lead , very is ?
so i think , in some medals it 's so , in vancouver , they were six grams a hard .
if that everything from the gold would , <unk> i 'm not here , i would have the <unk> , think i .
now , or in <unk> , <unk> <unk> .
but , i think , the real , why you do that , is more that , can imagine : what i ' i actually been created and how i mean skills and very focused on a point .
how i ' i in me in my skills , but of course , in the team , that we all need , whatever , in school , in the job in which one thing that .
anyway , whether an old man or young woman , we need for that people , in the we can .
and if we then this goal in the head clear , have eyes and that again , and it 's the best of evidence that we 're at least in a project in our lives that could .
and if you , once you can , it 's also , definitely in other areas .
thank you
a science for me , is the title of my talk , that is , <unk> your nice round of cards .
what i 'm driving , is the very <unk> effort , the sciences , again as something <unk> in the general population to attach .
in basically , i could either be .
if i in a <unk> <unk> , there 's all <unk> only with the literature to science , the <unk> <unk> is .
even any <unk> has a range of <unk> <unk> newspapers , magazines , <unk> , where science , collections , somehow get across the arts are .
every station has at least a <unk> , where some major issues of the endowment .
, it 's totally <unk> , if you look , what it , magazines and <unk> for children there with science data subjects .
every program has somehow , a own off in <unk> , but what does that a pure <unk> story .
science is one thing that the can i 'd like to see that can i 'd like reading , that 's me , not themselves .
cool , is cool science , only way , in csi , `` breaking bad , somewhere , there are the chemist cool , <unk> ?
in csi to look like a <unk> five minutes , it does n't do with the reality to do , but it 's cool , <unk> ?
there , you can i will identify .
big bang theory , because i can get a laugh , i understand the jokes , not , but it 's fine .
this is too .
because , that 's kind of a paradox of the future we 'll just manage to identify with these technological issues and themes .
but at bay area that none of to itself .
i have a few little examples of time i 've been doing , like science , or science , and now , that a given to have .
well , <unk> , in london , you have a tower being built , <unk> , the architect , let 's not so now , we build the time somehow being so <unk> .
what happens is , right now , the sunlight from up in the facade into , i realized that time <unk> well , the aid targets and somewhere in other that you on a point centre .
that was the size by the press , stood there , just a jaguar .
so sad , the heat , so you know that this poor <unk> , really long , long to go , there are the <unk> time .
there might ask you , as an architect , has n't that actually sort of times as a bit of what in physics have learned , because i mean , is yes , entirely new , that such a mirror of targets .
so , what i found , new , is <unk> , sort of & of christ , where he was supposedly , you are a fleet of an innocent .
there is and i really , what 's the more design or an architect , or where he has studied ?
now that 's a very <unk> example .
a classic , which is given such are topics , is also the <unk> .
<unk> , now that 's been a few years ago , when that just sort of the media got .
there was the train has sailed , because <unk> changed the plants , that was at a danger .
genes that was the gas , greener <unk> .
genes that were kind of what we first .
<unk> , oh , there are gene inside .
there 's all situations , where the market , really become like , hey , i <unk> vegetables .
no idea what that should be , yeah .
so , okay , dutch tomatoes , we can get a debate .
but to the time i was in the lab , active in and was eventually , frustrated , because i 've tried to these evil genes in my bacterial <unk> , these <unk> <unk> .
and was totally frustrated , came to home , and my day my neighbor , i 'd ask , you see , but it 's happy , which is because this ?
i like this : yeah , i 'm trying been there are three days as a little gene in my bacteria to transform and it 's all .
so that was , what i 've tried to to explain so it 's a <unk> , gene , i thought , you can see the good old lady , when i of genes are talking to know , , what she .
so that was , what i actually meant , so one particular sequence that i there in this <unk> <unk> i wanted to .
but that was , what the woman has seen before .
this woman , i 'm never again , the hand , all shook up !
who knows , what i do you <unk> , <unk> ?
genes is what 's very bad .
now that 's been good about 10 years ago , and yet , kind of consciousness ones .
genes , this is at what we first .
<unk> i 'm right time , you read .
it 's then , gene from their free and it , but really in our language , there 's thought .
<unk> to europe , was a headline .
<unk> different , a lot of other , corn , yes , does a gene that contains .
another kind of headline writers , <unk> , rats to die .
yes , that was also a headline .
the , but not so old and it 's also is no matter , on what level , i be ways .
anyway , whether the time , or the picture , all talk from <unk> .
fortunately , it 's still not <unk> in <unk> arrived , but i 'm afraid that takes too , long .
but this is just what kind of insecurity in the population is now , because they simply not with the themes of interest .
nevertheless , we 're in our future us with these technologies are .
now was just <unk> , nobody had the size of the subject , but it be about things are and some of what the most really no idea .
and it 's pretty sad .
how is actually , this information from the lab in the population ?
if we assume , this small , boy , this motivated , where are sitting in his lab , has an experiment , interactions , and so , beautiful and well , and he does think , man , that 's what that interested , but the public .
then to the first of the professor go .
the head , decides then , okay , very cool topic , of his name on a <unk> , that 's always important in science , <unk> be .
good idea , i still not the public , it goes to a <unk> .
yes , the <unk> think , oh great idea , class , because we make a press <unk> .
<unk> , because we have a press , with a project , a fabulous idea , and that 's coming then some way out of ivory coast .
this is then <unk> , but , who really ?
now , like the institute it alone , usually have multiple <unk> like a common of the design , a common <unk> .
and of all these are then the <unk> that really cool projects , then over the <unk> at the magazine given to with the editors , no matter whether it leibniz , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> are .
this is the way .
from the it 's going on and about , in ivory up into the really , really cool experiments , then , that actually speak of projects , there in these <unk> up .
that are out on a magazine that are really well done , there 's of all there 's free , but who get i 've seen it ?
in basically , just the that , for interest .
in the <unk> we call that the <unk> the <unk> .
so the that , already doing that interested in the <unk> then , the newspaper , beautiful and good .
as a magazine , the audience , that , for interest , and that maybe about an idea , where <unk> 's even in these articles .
who <unk> ' i so , but really ?
the <unk> the it anyway , actually .
the way that , now , the otto citizen , i call it might have a gentleman <unk> <unk> , under conditions , so you read , i tried , it 's not to expect to get i do n't really .
yet , again , our future , we will only way up to , if we do with these <unk> engage .
fracking , <unk> , renewables , <unk> , that are all , the <unk> are , the gentleman <unk> but not really understand , and over the he kind of voting by all .
my project , my idea is therefore , unlike that we need to this little , young , get a scientist out of ivory to take , really completely from its regular <unk> to separate , and he 's a course , to do , a seminar how to science , which communicates .
what is usually happens to a scientist , so i have a buddy , we know it 's been good about twenty years , he 's <unk> , it 's in us a <unk> rule , it 's not after his job to ask .
when he the mouth does and over his career telling , it 's got us <unk> .
<unk> , that scientists to tell you then , what of <unk> .
<unk> , it sounds , this chemical , <unk> , this chemical it is almost like the same level of genes .
this chemical treated , that 's kind , oh , you do n't know , which is .
the really teach , along time , that 's nice and well , if you on a conference , and there your people , your <unk> , on <unk> anything to tell you want them , you can you 'd like of <unk> tell , but glimpse , to say , just water on this .
where is the problem , it really <unk> and normal to talk ?
i school , that 's my idea , these young scientist , still not so far in the hierarchy <unk> are , still a little more malleable , the school , how to an argument .
that has for all of use , <unk> , as well , and investors , let 's also know , there in the <unk> happens .
eventually they , by that there are used , so the need to actually also the <unk> communicate .
but the these training , that 's just a story .
i want them , really a jury , sit and to your project to imagine your project a jury , very tough , <unk> , frankly , and there 's not , children .
there 's a quote , i do n't know if that is real , of albert einstein , if you do it 's not just tell you can , you 've got it does n't really understood .
so , the scientists from the lab to take and your project really to rethink , how to really quite normal , they communicate ?
so storytelling , there 's been a range .
<unk> are totally modern , is everywhere , in on each university of course , but there also get i in basically , just again , the <unk> .
who drive , because for <unk> the city in the university at some morning , then , there a talk to <unk> times . '' ?
these are the , it anyway , actually .
because i went back to my <unk> .
so , are the people that , anyway , of interest , there are driving , there is to get to listen .
that 's nice , there are any <unk> done , all these are satisfied , all these are happy to go to home and that 's it .
so i put them , on a second aspect to say , it is not the <unk> the project .
those scientists are also , trained , wired , actually children ?
because many really familiar illustration , to the essential to reduce .
because scientists , like the research , and how children , their world , exploring , is the same .
so to work very , scientifically .
they do anything like to learn from the walk .
they try to , it work ?
<unk> , fall , no way to do n't work , you to repetition , i change a couple of parameters , i do it , new .
children learn , scientifically .
that are really <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , i <unk> , what happens , which factors i do to that it works or not .
this is normal .
but that we have a illustration again .
and of so i think , really can work that only , after the <unk> of and those scientists had permanently in the neighborhood , in the environment with the children of kindergarten , from the school , there 's all these are the children , on their <unk> , and , there really do it with , because i believe that the children and the scientists , in basically , the same language .
and then you can perhaps , maybe some point , it 's my hope to tell the kids that , at home , and then i get i also , mr. <unk> , then also at the major issues are interested , because the children with him that tell .
this is then not anywhere in the newspaper , that 's not anywhere , galileo , but his children to tell him that it <unk> mirror , <unk> worked , that 's a bread <unk> , that it 's because paper is lit , and understand , and shaking you may also the head , like an architect 's a house can build .
and not just get i then , mr. <unk> , but the <unk> .
this is my idea , my vision , my project .
unfortunately <unk> it 's still very , that the first <unk> that i 'd have to have said , no way , so , <unk> for our scientists , that 's just not subject , and they 're looking at other priorities .
a scientist to yes , it can communicate .
yes , i think i then , okay , and i the next .
but who somehow , in a department at work , <unk> is in a company , as well , there 's in the next moment .
thank you .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
and fly you can also not every day .
the last few weeks were terrible .
the weather that has a big is through the calculation .
of seven , soon after eight years , i 've been asked , if i 'm here that they want .
i was before the ceo , almost 10 years , <unk> <unk> in munich , and in <unk> .
we 're there are quite far , up coming .
they had <unk> as a client .
and for me , actually more , well , this is <unk> .
what is this really ?
<unk> , that 's actually a ridiculous .
i then , but to know who is and so i stand here today .
and yes , maybe it 's a little crazy , but it is , too high , emotionally .
it 's nice and always exciting and makes great fun .
and i 'll just in the next <unk> , eighteen minutes a little bit of life of <unk> tell .
i was ceo in <unk> .
the company , there 's been a hundred and <unk> years .
i 'm the ceo of the <unk> .
this company , there 's been 20 years .
and ceo of <unk> .
the company , there 's been about <unk> or eighteen years .
the managing the <unk> here at <unk> .
<unk> .
that a picture that i do you here want to show the little one point , right , that 's really that a red , like a <unk> on , or anything to do n't know , yes , this is still going to the size .
there 's that are the world 's just <unk> <unk> .
and of these are actually just now , 10 to action .
this is also , what .
there 's about 20 thousand active global <unk> .
so that 's actually , no market .
that 's also not a niche interest .
this is a <unk> , a <unk> .
and the question is also , why do you that then i really ?
how does it all ?
<unk> in which was and only 10 to action , because we do afterwards , and talk about why this is .
very quickly the history .
<unk> , so many of crazy <unk> <unk> the back here 's started .
very short quick .
has to <unk> fourteen years ago , the first world war in eighteen <unk> the in '' .
then they were in the first world war , <unk> <unk> died , <unk> and <unk> , been around <unk> <unk> built for <unk> .
the world , and then in london , of the federal and so , and so on .
and when we <unk> and eight to london got these are , and with a big <unk> there a <unk> campaign to fly , they do the newspapers <unk> with the headline said , this time you come , but not to bombs , but in a peaceful and purpose .
so that has the story in there <unk> .
and we had an insane campaign .
but <unk> , the client , was not so very pleased to because he suddenly realized that 's gone , what 's still going to put that old memory in there 'd put them .
and you know that was , for the marketing -- a critical .
but it was in london a great campaign , except the weather in north end up there was many years ago , very bad and very <unk> .
and we 're not very much for flying .
then , <unk> two decades , <unk> <unk> hugo <unk> this has taken .
and has a <unk> for maybe , then to america and delivered by the world .
that has a myth , where that the german nation of course , again something felt , as , which <unk> and <unk> that airship has been .
there was the then , in new york city received a pin .
and the german nation 's got up , <unk> , we 're back , who .
this is in all about this is inside and it 's so that tells a little that myth of this device .
but actually are then to <unk> and <unk> just five , six , seven <unk> even still were built and really only two really big , the <unk> <unk> and the hindenburg , the passengers happening .
passengers a hundred , where about <unk> passengers , and <unk> it was the end <unk> <unk> .
it was , but a myth .
and the <unk> then was at the first broadcast live , these are the crash , there , unfortunately , yes <unk> .
next to the titanic that event at , where a an icon , a a product <unk> is , and then also never more and then in flight .
also the other , by itself .
and <unk> , <unk> the past , no , the <unk> destroyed .
that the materials used for <unk> , <unk> , the halls ground .
and then i was for nothing about their sixties years .
and then the had the <unk> zf <unk> and <unk> , and they had the idea , maybe you want to the back to start .
and i was hired <unk> , because you , technically a brilliant product has evolved to come we 'll notice that , but the market .
yes , he 's actually a market ?
what is there 's actually go ?
so .
and talk about that we now .
the <unk> <unk> , that may still just to explain , we ham , in time it 's still , <unk> , who has a lot .
there 's many companies , because of corporation that are .
it are today <unk> , about 20 billion of revenue .
this is a right of the world , the profitable .
there 's a lot behind .
the 've got me , believe , here on up to come .
the <unk> , is really a very regular plane as each other infinite plane as well , but it , sorry , very a gas , the helium 's not hydrogen , and very , a <unk> with <unk> .
is like a whale , in the water on and under there , and the <unk> do to .
the time now is not there , in the details to understand .
it looks a <unk> so , with a structure .
there 's two types of <unk> .
there 's rigid <unk> , that we , <unk> in the case , and <unk> .
the have drawn inward , no structure and they are sort of how balloons , <unk> .
these are the most <unk> , in the world was built , about four , kilometer .
and it 's only today , as i said , only still <unk> in which was with our own was , so around the only still two decades .
this is then the production , if a shell where one is .
the left the structure , .
and the shell is also <unk> .
comes from the <unk> .
source : the <unk> the astronauts .
<unk> then there are the roots .
so it 's one point two million dollars , like a shell .
and is to <unk> , to <unk> , and must also <unk> , because , you have to yes , at that if a crack in it would or a hole that 's not going to tear it .
there are doing the <unk> again <unk> do and look , whether they 're going on the holes in control .
and the end looks a airship that without the international community of like it 's there .
the <unk> is so technically a <unk> product
and that you see here at the numbers , very short time .
one point where nine percent , one point where nine percent , one point , six four percent <unk> , that means of a thousand flights in about falling , maybe <unk> .
this is very little bit and very good .
this is a <unk> .
that can be able to see .
but there 's a different trend , the us at about power and the world , and i ended up here 's mapped .
we had three years ago <unk> percent <unk> , when i started ago , <unk> five , eight years ago , <unk> percent <unk> and last year <unk> percent <unk> or <unk> .
and this year in may , we were sixties percent .
if you the eight years , eight years , <unk> <unk> and <unk> it , something that wants , then you can say at least in these eight years , obviously a <unk> the <unk> , also clear , in these eight years , of weather , clearly changed for us .
we 're <unk> .
we can because the passengers , not by the fog .
the want , yes , that you see .
and the <unk> or <unk> up , every year , has to .
so a picture of that our weather , not just felt , but also , statistically , because we do the weather , every day , to change .
but because that 's so , this is now that well , the e.u. , a program <unk> <unk> to do , almost 10 million dollars , and we 're an essential part of this program .
i come today morning , from finland .
that airship on this is here on , is a flying lab .
<unk> called the campaign .
and we do <unk> in the <unk> between earth and <unk> feet .
that means <unk> <unk> .
and the <unk> in time flies , italy , to get up to finland in a <unk> <unk> .
over many many hundreds <unk> measuring the and analyzed the air out how to the chemical , and on our things that we the bottom , do .
there , so i just explain , up there are we 're dealing with the other airship on .
a great a great assignment .
and is that if you want to have extracted from the subject of weather .
that 's so very well .
and here are now , a few <unk> .
that airship on top of sweden , the last week or <unk> week .
and in finland is the way the weather 's good , <unk> , <unk> degrees , 30 degrees .
the <unk> say that they were still never .
i i 've got there 's wonderful , as a warm days , you know .
the right ? were actually , not so bad .
we were also in africa .
and have for de <unk> as <unk> diamond , for , better said volcanoes for the underground , that go away , through the erosion of a million years .
just beside you , asking , is , that 's all over africa , is that then a more sense if you , sort of questions , for an idea of questions , after a sense of thing is it makes sense if at the theater at the film <unk> or the blood diamond 's gone .
because i time ever wondered , you know what we do it 's really ?
and what i like that it really ?
the end , we were after two years , done .
the <unk> was actually , not on .
the entire <unk> came back then <unk> and the project was then finish .
and a tornado , the <unk> the mast , then at that damaged , that he also going down to be able to .
well , not so bad .
we had been there 's pretty good insurance , and they were a very happy .
that was looking at the prototype .
and i did n't know what i do to be .
yes , what we do , a very quick <unk> of the studied there .
what we do , it goes , just to , it 's about complexity , it 's about questions , growth or it .
what we do is the <unk> here in <unk> .
we do to service of course .
we have to the <unk> always get .
<unk> called an aging .
there are yes , as well , inside , after 10 , have been back to be replaced .
we replace , the entire <unk> for nearly five million dollars .
there with the clients <unk> talk about we still .
we do we need to the <unk> constantly doing .
we 're a general aviation <unk> going to the of the germans <unk> and the european and we do that body is , every time , and the time , even more like <unk> , or how we also an airbus .
and this <unk> and costs money and to and also going to get .
the question is : do you actually on ?
you want to develop ?
you make greater <unk> ?
there 's <unk> , unmanned <unk> .
what do you there are really ?
you go on the market ?
you go further in the ?
and that we have , my time , one .
and we 've also some <unk> suffered .
how the way , the <unk> <unk> some <unk> sustained has and this bust .
at the billboard stood still the donation of <unk> .
the population of the population has it was saved with six million <unk> as a donation , as the fourth airship crashes , and he , really broke , has the population him a donation .
and it 's all the <unk> <unk> <unk> and the other companies that way , otherwise we were or <unk> i am today anyway , not here and other companies would n't there .
we were in tokyo , <unk> .
we were , and you hear the past , in san francisco , with a customer .
it to put a very <unk> <unk> .
two projects are actually failed .
so , <unk> .
simultaneously , we have <unk> won .
because i 'm not a picture that , because we that <unk> <unk> still not show you can .
but just in america is now the <unk> the first <unk> in the finished .
we have three and sells .
with <unk> that we like a with a mate , the technique again .
and that 's a huge success , but at the defeat to leave you .
two who are , <unk> been , because it was .
why did n't it ?
we know it actually already .
it was the location , not the right or the passengers had to go far <unk> or in america 's not know you <unk> the last 30 forty years , the commercials have done .
the ham , people have <unk> , have the airship that have said , i 'd ask , again , again , <unk> , the power .
there can that we did n't that , <unk> can .
and it was quite a double the hard in marketing is over to : hey , by calling , and it .
<unk> 's good .
the pilots to transport , to transport , embrace <unk> , <unk> passengers .
but last year we only <unk> done because of weather .
there are then the same , once a half million .
this is the bad .
the <unk> going <unk> are here .
it 's the sense , the course is beautiful , when i also when ceos , then i see how the passengers get out and , and all laughing and we , also not advertising , because it 's mouth to speak about and again and we got about <unk> sold <unk> , and the people say , that 's so beautiful , and i recommend it your friends , which and whom , and up , in the family .
and we are great 's .
which i and out messy to do with the mistake that you think we are -- she .
you could still more flights to do .
we have so a <unk> the <unk> and we were -- she .
so that is actually also not quite .
we do , advertising .
this is a project was that audi <unk> .
and an audi this has done here with the island <unk> together .
but the <unk> is a difficult to market .
and you have to make things that , the <unk> imagine : do advertising , of this ?
we have yes , enough ads , but the internet has much change , the <unk> about the launch , because the <unk> all of .
the <unk> is largely <unk> that 's why you today is still 10 active <unk> in the world .
we have three here .
two active , one , put that <unk> , three , <unk> bought , 10 are actively .
so , then six of 10 .
that means that we 'll then the market , if it does one is to control .
and hope , it also again a future in the way to .
and what the end with david , scott , commander of the apollo six , after his <unk> paris <unk> and five , he said , just at the walk on the <unk> what <unk> .
so <unk> 's beautiful .
advertising do we also find you .
only we find any customers .
<unk> to do we find great , which has a technological value .
because we have any customers .
that 's not , has been .
it 's <unk> , goes on and .
so , like a bid takes years until you can to get .
and then there 's then again , no .
there 's also kind of the effect that easy for and hard to control .
, is that the situation , <unk> , a point in the market , so , no market .
yet we do on .
it 's an icon of the region .
the <unk> have the power to do it .
they ask , just about the question : in what form we make it on ?
how much money give you 're in the market ?
what do what do for this ?
in what form is so what they 're going ?
and i personally , they 've got me also asked , a personal to say , i 'm sort of course , my history <unk> , where i <unk> <unk> wanted to go back against the big , drag , <unk> has this little <unk> dead , you want , it 's also here to rescue .
i was also again , greenpeace was three years <unk> , when i went through the vancouver island of risks , and this whole <unk> come up seeing what you have to me , that <unk> , that i was there was doing surgery .
and then there 's a <unk> about greenpeace , the money , being , and do n't know what they do to be and almost took it to actually gone .
because they have to employ to it 's going to <unk> .
and i have three years for greenpeace was as <unk> and now i showed this in the hope , a future in <unk> to achieve .
zero , this true ? for seconds , i 'm not yet done , thanks .
<unk>
yes , thank you .
that are my three penalty points that i in the eighteen minutes to go to .
why we are today in from mountains , or are plenty of ?
how we come to their ?
and so , what to do ?
what it what 's there are really ?
we start with our first point .
the first part is perhaps a pretty depressing .
but it 's also , right , the challenges to show .
a few years about , that still more difficult to have been , of way to understand .
that we have a problem have today , you know every child .
that we environmental problems .
but it 's worth , , and over time to suggest that are the challenges that growth for example .
all kinds of <unk> these exponential increase .
if you put it in a historical long view , you see , the oil for example , it 's a very short episode in the story has been to be .
today , we can not imagine that 's kind of different about , when that oil and keep up .
you know the climate change , the last <unk> years .
some people say , well , once there 's time the columbian mammoth , we look at the last <unk> years .
it is also <unk> at , <unk> ' i also , right .
and you can say , who needs because the glacier ?
and you can say , the ocean is far away .
but it goes , then , if you , a little bit more closely with to sort of real challenge to things that 's really to avoid being true , otherwise we 've just in the <unk> , health .
<unk> it turns out there days over 30 degrees .
and there 's degree , in our cities like in vienna , or <unk> of , and increasingly , of bad .
it goes , but also the <unk> , in asia .
you think about the himalayas , where the big can see what and the <unk> of them on that there with water from the himalayas is .
it 's the end , not the planet .
the planet is that <unk> , what we do , because there 's been much larger , crisis .
and <unk> , but it 's about us to the people that , in in an altered our ecosystems , very uncomfortable will live .
it 's about loss of biodiversity .
the deserts broad .
the water is less and .
this is the aral sea , where an essential part of cotton , from .
and all this , where that come from ?
all these bad things , say , ' , on the one or another form with the global <unk> together .
so , what we all of the earth , get , what we harvest .
not just the oil and the metals and the minerals , but the power of resources are , renewable , but the scarce .
and we should just look at that we so little as many of use to also the less than waste and the emissions to produce .
so it goes around it , that 's in the introduction , already told by the <unk> really dramatically to reduce .
this is the challenge , not only climate , not just a c , you know , two , <unk> of a car on a different , but really differently to live .
unlike the economies .
our technique that get to change .
if we , just look back the hunters and it were , and there 's still on the earth societies , in principle that life , come with a ton of resources in the year per person and year .
in a <unk> it was then in the longest time the human history of three to five million tons .
now , it fifteen to <unk> .
so <unk> , this <unk> .
and he 's very , was distributed around the earth .
it 's in north , more than with us to us more than for the earth , portable .
and in other parts of the world , look on africa , much less .
and to come , we 's the implications for us , the rivers , the air is much better to become in the last decades , but it 's basically , that we that in other parts of the shift .
and the other parts of the let the but less and like .
and why are also the conflict that we see , of <unk> , is , afghanistan , you look at them in the maps of the american geological survey , and then you see , where the resources from .
and this is there is it 's very colorful , which is , there 's many materials there , where the <unk> the world .
so if we do with clean want , then we need to do with the subject of interest .
so we have to change , the ecological limits what are everywhere , the <unk> is everywhere .
and that , what we here , <unk> life , is not <unk> .
that has been of mahatma gandhi , were as he said , the world has enough for being needs , but not for everybody 's greed .
and there we are , we here in the average life , a lot of it .
so .
that was sort of <unk> part .
but i think , that you the needs to understand it 's worth , what to change .
however , i later would say , it 's worth , like that way to live , which is more of their .
but it is , and out of , from the <unk> <unk> you need , a rationale , say , i time .
so , which is actually their ?
and we need to find that we 're in our to share the world , so much , economically , socially , quality , at the standard , us in the average , often do n't feel .
here 's a pretty good mood , but there 's people , and you 're certainly , people that 's not that good can deal with this story .
i time i wrote that there .
<unk> and climate have the same cause .
we work of them and to do .
this is the one side and we get yourself in the stress , and eventually it 's too much .
i 'm also very happy to .
and the other side of we just this <unk> .
what is then a good life ?
like , we can be what ?
now here 's a a little piece of break .
this is also , what i 'd say we have and what i later tell me is science of the grounded planes , but it there 's just figure , how to of the first time is defined ?
and there 's important , to understand better life has always two aspects .
the quality , the aspect of the objective conditions as it me about what to food to have .
i was a roof over the head ?
i was friends ?
i really , i can of participate ?
but it 's also , which is how it to me , how do , i have to the ?
i <unk> ' that sometimes the perceived quality .
and then <unk> ' i two words in order , at the are important .
this is the needs .
the needs are the very fundamental way our human development , our there 's drum to feelings .
if we need is that we can , we 're happy .
and what you ca n't say , needs are strongly , or not sustainable .
the needs by se 're still not to <unk> .
what are the needs ?
you can be different place in a quote , i think is the only two called .
and there you , the physical needs , but also need for safety , social relations .
after the protection , for participation , <unk> , creativity , spirituality , after the freedom .
all this has a little do with money to do .
but to a lot of men 's not actually , but the question is , how can i think that in my life up .
and there i the second important term .
the strategies .
the strategy that i 'm going to me to spend it went to me that needs to meet .
and there 's then , you know , that i can sort of dealing with a high <unk> or with a low <unk> do .
because i can not much money to hire or a little money .
strategies , you saw my behavior as i was my needs <unk> .
that has with my values to do with the resources , with the possibilities that i .
if i little money got wind ' i did my needs to try to meet as if i , so much money on the bank account of have .
it 's first of the <unk> , is the roof over the head , to eat , and then sort of the <unk> .
and here 's then you know , it with a lot sooner or a little <unk> , it sort of that , or <unk> be .
and if we all the strategies that 's made me to stand to my needs to satisfy to summarize , then we talk from a lifestyle .
so .
that was sort of scientific break .
and now let 's figure out what we can do now ?
how does it 's how does it ?
and there 's just a couple of evidence .
now , to the kind of , everyone for , which i find .
but the evidence of the individual 's kind of a technological way , here is , think , i , also about technology 've been and finally , on a political leaders that .
what we can do ?
what we can do ?
what we do ?
so , where we want to go ?
the slides to have to sort of said , the danger is that we kind of the more and consumption , more resources that use .
the end , the quality of back down , because that , the effects , and there are , as it , and on us the back to beat .
or , whether we do it , there in a different direction of going to less <unk> , may also with less than consumption , but with a higher quality that are connected .
there 's one of my <unk> , maybe you know , some , <unk> of <unk> of this topic <unk> , so no longer life with less <unk> .
there 's a lot of technology as i can each one thing that here we use the computer , the orange juice , the coffee , the car , the traffic , how can i felt that make ?
cement , what else to produce , i can that house of wood to build , were for .
now , with a much less <unk> more or the same quality to create .
my other teachers , <unk> <unk> that 's like to put it , the <unk> per <unk> , and we 're at the , which is also have time talking about that was , there 's very deep down there on a 's companies to look .
where are actually the needs ?
what services , i can really satisfy us ?
and how to , as little <unk> do ?
and that 's not with a little bit less , but with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> percent less .
there 's many examples of the kind of you can .
in vienna , to a seven-story building be built with two are allowed .
with seven percent allowed it 's in <unk> already built .
that basically , from wood , is .
that you , maybe it in fifty years , you need to dissect it and then again in its parts and not so , so , very much less resources out it with all other , you go from there of in the moment with the half and the goal is a fifth of the <unk> , over the whole lifetime of the house while dealing with this one fifth of <unk> long .
it goes , but also a lot in our own , the <unk> ' i really ?

where he shows , how hard it in the end is sort of really from the from the kind of out of the treadmill out .
the <unk> , i want to me , so to go over the others come after , and then i 'm sort of forever , in this in this race in there .
you yourself , of , they 're doing that i quickly to hit , and then they do , i was the new .
the most <unk> ' i the <unk> , that you know of all .
when i my department founded was a few years ago , we 've still a letter writing .
then , of , wait to be able to the letter back to write , i ai email , it ai hell <unk> .
to write , i hundreds of email .
and i can be very much longer afford .
this is productivity , that 's growth , we get that in a back .
but i did n't really time to go .
i for me and failure is done .
but there 's good examples , slow food for instance where i really sort of the claim the quality and the claim the <unk> in the foreground , taking place .
and with a low <unk> more quality to do .
one of my one is <unk> .
there 's a best-selling , now , it so , ai average person we had in germany , in austria , thousands of things in a household .
you can time to count .
if you have two years ago , three generations of thousands of things had , had to pick them .
the have us to manage .
we must have to deal .
and less and people come to realize , with these all options .
and we need a raising , the us and helps to the us , <unk> with these few things that interest .
if only , think , i really interesting , perhaps is also , ai n't use the spacecraft , there 's go out to think , i , also not thousands of things .
the next example is use instead of having .
an boom .
the star , <unk> , <unk> , of , perhaps , 20 years of , in the alternatives it was developed .
in the meantime , use it always more people , if you , <unk> thinking .
if you , <unk> thinking .
instead , and business that easy to work , where do you the things that we already have these beautiful <unk> here , a few hundred years was built still , so to use and still about the other centuries , to use it 's about the end .
that , even invested was just better to use .
this is the end , as a question of justice .
i showed you before , how profoundly unequal , that 's take you that as a picture , between africa and europe and a one , and the world .
so that all of the with these resources to get to , it 's only then as possible , if we really can use less .
and that means that 's not less quality , because of us as it has been sort of of them .
but it 's an important to the economy , the company , these products , those services , actually available to imagine that we need to us a good life to do with a much less resources .
last point , that has also something with the large scale on to do <unk> after the growth , <unk> ' i was the time .
if you a little attention of the quest to read , it 's been back from below oecd , <unk> , now that <unk> every week are these predictions , again , down <unk> .
it means , a crisis that 's in the door , i think , and after the , what we kind of a great deal with the economists have been talking and with , here are the numbers of austria , you find that it for all of growth , just after the bottom .
and there 's no reason to grow to have the way that as i know that from my youth , from the 1960 , i know .
of rice , that in math reasons .
one point five percent growth is today , so much like eight percent growth and fifty years .
and that eight percent is that , what china , today .
that are also , there , where we may ago , and fifty years were .
in general , if the pie bigger is , of course , harder , eight percent <unk> .
this one percent is still a lot , so we will be good living .
but you have to sort of you put up , i mean , not even if we zero percent growth would have , i would that , the next year , so much of , and consume and incomes , like in this year .
that we can , and so we can work .
and this is why not that wrong , because you these statistics have to show that growth on been , and , with the quality .
the economy grows , but the quality of stays in , we countries , and i said , we are .
and the way , jobs are also , without growth , and this is not that we came together , like this tells us and out of <unk> and how they all this suggests is .
so that is simply not and then you have to , time with the economy of interest .
and it comes , and increasingly , and also <unk> like a more or next week , think , i , in coming in the trend , a larger story with that start on , through .
already <unk> , edward <unk> , the day nobel prize in his <unk> so i asked myself that he said , the good life the good business , the good economy <unk> <unk> the good life .
it 's about the end , and not to not primarily by the returns to create , not primarily to grow to do for our countries do n't even more about .
for the peru , and these countries , indeed , china , for india there 's the ai n't very different story .
and this is the only then they are also under <unk> , if we there , still going to grow and we just sort of on this level , on this high level , we 're good on life and economies .
this is it 's also , politics .
it targets .
it going to say the economists .
it 's not just sort of the growth , but we should actually look and measure and ask , what about , with the quality , up the to ?
is the down ?
and then also our politicians to measure .
of course , as high , is the <unk> ?
how does it , together ?
we need a essentially one aspect of this is , the <unk> finally to tax , and not the work .
who of them in the entrepreneurs , you , but also the employees , you know that very well .
what kind of the control walk away , we know , in a colleague , paid .
that you could very differently .
the resources are sort of reduces and so among the resources in taxes , and not the work .

that goes , but i mean , the sort of a little bit better .
that conclusion , more or less , on all levels it in this direction worked , we can be hard , we can be a company , the right products , services as a consumer sort of us questions , what we actually , who do that what 's sort of good for us ?
what we need and what we may not ?
the politics and vote , the framework for a hard .
a couple of i described .
and the end of course , the science <unk> percent of fellow is still in the direction , like , we can grow up ?
now , but nobody ever done .
if you that the quest to see if you of all look at the last two years , it goes , after the bottom , because it 's not about .
the politics does n't and the fellow will not growth to create , but this is the question how we go , the world , which is that we have a good life of ?
so , <unk> 's to do it .
be the <unk> you <unk> to lake .
with heart , the brain , hand , and the end , the spirit we 're going to need .
thank you .
i 'm <unk> <unk> .
and i love this town .
this town , so many stories to tell .
one of them , a few hundred years happened .
and has to do with creative problem-solving .
on this creative problem-solving i 'll , and the story that later .
they 're going to have with the fortress <unk> .
this is an ai <unk> , here in the middle of the city is , and so much of this city , mind , and does .
one another story .
it was on a hot summer in <unk> , nevada .
a man is , on once in his shoes , right that it right <unk> .
to him to 's warm .
he 's europeans , he knows that 's not so with the heat .
he does so one he pulls the shoe of it takes a knife <unk> also not a spike in , several times makes it 's a lot of holes in .
he pulls the shoe , there 's actually be a knife , and notice he has a climate in shoe .
it 's the shoe , breathing , born .
and this number , you see here is the show in the <unk> of these billionaires the mario <unk> is today .
a company is <unk> that way , with four letters .
the , or another one of you know it .
he has the original idea , nike and adidas are .
both have died .
so he says , well , <unk> , i do my own business .
<unk> it goes on the stock market .
about today , several thousand people in just three hundred of businesses in about <unk> countries in the world .
so much for the creative problem-solving .
why not something to invent stuff that still not there is ?

if you <unk> still do n't know , it is for what 's an opportunity ?
this question that has to me , often did , in a tough .
if something has gone wrong is , or my collaborator <unk> me or a technology does n't work or what that .
<unk> , little memory , <unk> .
what 's an opportunity ?
and , you get from <unk> the <unk> .
what that could make <unk> ' i do with this example here to illustrate .
and a different example , of the <unk> <unk> now , the <unk> of total of <unk> .
and the evidence , like creative people can be if it 's about their own insurance .
i want you a few examples here show .
that are so in fact that was in the <unk> <unk> and that has it also an ad .
i <unk> , the awesome .
my son has the woman does n't <unk> .

or i had the whole day , plants , where when i way , the achieved , grew up a sudden , the bush in my view , and i could this other car , you see .
that very , who 's one is , right ?
the bush .
the <unk> are <unk> .
i 'm <unk> and two times , almost died .
because they can see me , but at least that half <unk> on .
the last thing i was the crash was n't blame .
one was the young woman in <unk> .
if you a man who are , is each other statement , do .
if you , but a woman who are , you know about it anyway , not .
so people are creative , we 're creative .
and i wish , and i dream of that we all the more of creativity to use .
many of us are in a <unk> <unk> .
and that does n't have to be like this .
why not things just time i do differently ?
old things that we do the present , from become are , maybe i 've got bored , or <unk> , as opposite .
why the not just time i do differently , that <unk> , as a little simple <unk> .
and there 's so <unk> company , the use this .
for example <unk> , but this <unk> of their so what they are , these signs , or at the wall , for example , and there is then maybe so what on .
also a way , right ?
let 's the coffee order to be rather than to <unk> .
or so what .
we do n't put wifi , <unk> you .
is yes , today , regular , right ?
if you the phone , not something you can .
or eat them with me , otherwise , starvation , we both .
you have , but creative .
so something that it 's .
i only ' one of the client or an environment , then go , and say , okay , that i like .
that <unk> ' i went .
a prison <unk> , in the should do the current day <unk> , in <unk> .
once the sport , the current economic news , once upon politics .

even got the complaint about to long <unk> the food .
it 's a <unk> building and this restaurant , very small , so i had the chefs take all shook hands of to do .
it was to look closely .
the have thought , together , what we do ?
how do we the problem ?
we ca n't pick up to be in the kitchen .
this is created .
on every table , interrupted <unk> <unk> order to fresh <unk> salt , pepper , and a <unk> .
so that , an environment , wait on it to eat their <unk> , let myself , you 're able to .
just a different .
a creative idea , and maybe with the <unk> solved .
there 's a person the power , currently not just popular .
you that person is the leader in the <unk> , so the <unk> the <unk> .
and now <unk> yes , the german , very much .
and the second day , that takes it , a monday , so four days .
a company has <unk> <unk> to the staff of a month , who wants , and you know you might say , which .
a <unk> says , rather <unk> , we thank you .
the people come to us to book <unk> .
the bus who are full , it 's <unk> run , people to organize the carpool , because each of course , other hand , because for , of a boca , b to come .
but why do n't let 's also now to use and creatively , from his great to do ?
sometimes it happens : yeah , creativity also <unk> .
and it comes from a <unk> maybe it , just like this company , that you might .
so we have yes , i knew that 's where the <unk> n't really goes well , but that you in the <unk> also , saving to 's something to worry .
or the <unk> in the car .
there , we know , the different , <unk> , and all possible directions .
yes .
why , not a piece from the car on , if you <unk> 's right ?
or in <unk> there 's also have to be able to create .
and all that has to do it with humor , with joy , sometimes it 's stupid , <unk> ?
sometimes it 's funny .
once was my <unk> son , in my office .
and sitting on this <unk> of me .
so , we have multiple <unk> around the <unk> .
and then turning it from left to right , it 's got joy , and i held in stinking <unk> say , to you , listen , this is yes , not a playground here .
he said to me , look at me , big eyes , the playground .
and in the moment <unk> ' i actually he 's right , right ?
why is not a playground today ?
why is that , what we do , not the playground for adults ?
that if only , but much more sense , right ?
if we sort of these are , if we our talents to use to do that , what we like to do .
and excellence in pursuit , but it 's a way .
that appear to is that when a particular day , the week , then it changes , what in our brain .
it 's the first day in the week , and it 's our focus on another one day .
so one other day we usually prefer .
so the weekend .
this sounds , yes , already in the media .
on thursday 's called `` yes , only still a day to the weekend .
or if then the most beautiful time the year , announced it , the vacation .
what are then the rest <unk> weeks of the year ?
it is that dreadful ?
we 've all so awful , jobs ?
a <unk> did it 's the front page made , this topic .
yes , monday , can ' i and the rest of life , you ask yourself .
or on <unk> , on facebook , anywhere in social networks is this issue up .
once was walking , i go through the <unk> , one of the <unk> in <unk> .
there 's a lot of business and i look at me , like this .
what , so in the <unk> , there 's like ?
and one day , stuck , i 'm in this business with these signs to buy .
and the first sign that you see here , this is yes , a very nice .
so , with so i love to do instead to work .
i <unk> that yes , i 'm a father of five kids , but i 'm also my work anymore .
yes .
or a <unk> for <unk> is that <unk> sign .
why that your mindset that , there is it becomes , increasingly , and on .
somebody has been there times as an answer on this direction , posted it 's not the monday , it are your jobs .
and i wonder , even in fact , with the pink , glasses , this forward to come and say , okay , ' time a shift .
what at my job is beautiful ?
this silly , is , let 's the pink , glasses , is , it looks at all right , like before .
so something nice to talk , does this is beautiful , it 's clearly not .
the pink , glasses , is the way that 's good for bicycle , drive .
there holding them a wonderful , the fly , the else in the eye into this would .
but to <unk> <unk> they do n't .
where is that , if we do n't that change ?
indeed , job , the content , our <unk> ?
within the company , outside of <unk> .
it ends , maybe in a system where we have that we feel like the mouse .
the mouse up a in this cycle , and running and running and goes , and eventually it 's to quickly , this cycle , it hits the mouse and you , their out .
what makes the mouse , but it ?
you know , nothing else , she goes back in the <unk> .
and again , and again and perhaps the movie , every day <unk> that <unk> you may all , falls , yes , soft .
that 's nice <unk> here with hay , so they do , yes , because failure and it goes and over again , so there .
and that , what we as funny feeling probably has the mouse , eventually , concussion , yeah ?
or something that it 's that <unk> <unk> .
i felt , many years ago , so when i on was one of students at home .
and at was , so the street under me , felt it was very , black , my eyes and somehow got ' i stop .
the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , which is there on ?
he got me and said , no way that 's physically , everything okay .
but how to look , with the <unk> from ?
and i looked in my calendar , the three to check , and saw , i worked for three weeks , and somehow bugging me , the job .
after two years in the <unk> and collaborator , the first of the early been wondering whether we look at night in the end you can do .
i also thought , what 's actually , otherwise , for jobs ?
and i started , <unk> , again , other priorities and set , to let me to time with my family <unk> , something good for me , which i 'm doing .
<unk> , whether it ai other <unk> there in my job , a spark off .
i 've begun to get a large groups that make me really joyful .
, ' , as a benign advice and <unk> and other things , but this to get to pulses of giving to , so let me share that it for me really joyful .
and this was n't always like .
i have to see , to that this <unk> can get sick of power .
and sometimes it 's really this shot of the so , <unk> of me is , it back from the hospital , i had been , after he 's a heart attack or so , and on once he starts as well , <unk> .
sooner than i said , you 're getting with some jogging , it 's got me , <unk> , you with your running and so .
now , it yourself .
so , with <unk> , beautiful slow , in the right <unk> , but eventually we will also , together , jogging , go .
what ?
in the bottom line , we all the healthier .
the <unk> go down , but a curve that goes , is the diseases of mental health .
<unk> minus four percent in the shrink the last 10 years , <unk> of minus fifty percent , that 's nice , this is less .
of the rise of psychiatric disorders , plus & percent .
this is something , where i think , to that be ?
why is that ?
it 's just in austria , so ?
no , also in germany , it 's so .
<unk> , <unk> , this is all healthier .
that 's so here on the left side to recognize .
it down and psychiatric disorders of plus a hundred percent in the last 10 years , finds a a big german <unk> out .
the number <unk> continuing to take to .
also the cost .
and it 's think , all kinds of official , what we can do with this topic ?
do this -- sometimes form , it , involuntary <unk> , like for example here .
so this is good thing .
and somebody has once said , no alcohol , is also not a solution .
but what is then the solution ?
what is then that , which gives us , but again , healthy , and it , and with delight to ?
and that , i was the last years busy .
i thought , there 's something like <unk> , it 's something that even though there ?
i figure , the job is not that , what we <unk> it , and happy to do .
there 's many other things that are important , family , health , think , and so forth .
but in fact is , we the most of our <unk> in the work on .
and if we do that , why then not that do that 's take pleasure think , and also by anything else .
the <unk> <unk> ' i do you <unk> , as the last , provide anything like to <unk> and to <unk> this .
these little had no , you , hopefully then this is .
<unk> is for a globe , liberty and environment .
i mean , how <unk> ' i mean , talents ?
in which the surroundings do , i think that , with whom ?
the freedom . i ' i 'm here , to do this , what i want to do ?
because it 's the degree of <unk> , the us <unk> .
ever more of them , more and more stress .
and what i do it ?
the globe .
that are these four areas .
and it can everyone for , the test .
i had this for me , ourselves by a few years , and i do this is constantly , and it .
can i mean , talents to use ?
in which the environment ?
and i mean , sometimes you go , i in a coffee with my laptop , the seminar prepare a <unk> .
freedom .
the freedom , i can take the to do , what i 'd expect it .
and do i 's also ?
the globe .
the last ted u .
and then there 's , people to me to explain why do n't that goes .
and why this at them much harder .
then i mostly , like an answer , taking place .
who wants to find ways .
who do n't have been to the reasons .
and by the place you to choose <unk> ' i ways , `` get ' i ways , or will have , i reasons why ?
and they 're in both right .
what do with our talents ?
each of you has his great <unk> around .
that is yes , a lot of small .
that 's filled with a talent , with the gold , with all , with their skills .
what do it ?
by the end of questions that .
or if we in the hospital will be possible , or the end of life .
what i started with my talent done ?
the way , who 's like it has on <unk> <unk> , can do afterwards , here 's still access .
so , what do with our talents , is so my first question , as well , i consider myself , every day .
<unk> ' i the good enough ?
and resources .
there was yet another thing with a story .
that i wanted to tell about <unk> .
and that <unk> ' i at the still do .
this fortress which was the rescue center for the <unk> as a shrink five years , the enemies , and it .
and the enemies , we realized that these fortress so well , built was that you do n't take could .
thick walls sixties ways that <unk> the fortress , thick and doors , <unk> , can see on .
i was <unk> at .
so we thought , this , okay if we do n't get in , then we form a <unk> .
we let 's no more out and in .
let 's look how long , that there , goodness .
the <unk> think it was from long until the day came , where the supplies of it was .
they had only still a <unk> the was already on the way to slaughtered out to be as the <unk> at the bishop says , the bishop give me that <unk> and give me three days .
bishop okay , <unk> , you have you been proven , i <unk> , you , come to take the <unk> and help us .
<unk> goes with the <unk> way .
at the bottom the enemies , how about the wall , the fortress is a <unk> pulled it is led , from left to right and already in the early .
well , think that the , a <unk> , which is that .
it 's <unk> .
again , <unk> <unk> , the top of the wall and the fortress , this is it all the black .
enemies , think , oh , still has two <unk> , it can ' , take you .
at night i did the scenario , , this is he knows the <unk> , there , and go from here is led .
the second day , after the six different <unk> have seen the bottom , they 're in a <unk> .
because they thought that takes us to long , that we hold on myself , from .
and then went to the <unk> down to <unk> and <unk> the <unk> .
the one , they had and the they <unk> have .
that are the <unk> <unk> .
i like this idea that everything there is , what we need , and that we have anything .
, it from the resources , sometimes it 's not much , sometimes it 's a little bit .
but also , so we can now , but do something .
we have no idea of the power that we have the world every day to reinvent ourselves .
and if you believe that could now a good <unk> be then you have right .
in the spring from the spring .
the coming .
and we in <unk> know there is the snow , because it 's getting there 's the plants , of branches brown <unk> to green <unk> to be .
there are blooms some form of those blooms fruits .
there are apple here 's very popular argument that we then we harvest and eat .
there 's actually do this grain could we then the ground and bread , baking .
because there any animals , that eat .
there 's people , then the products that it later , food .
and it 's automatically .
if you , but i think about that perhaps not that and everything is it 's a fear and so anxious .
and of course , this threat , maybe just very ambiguous and , theoretically , but just in the blooms of the connection of the flower to plant are bees fly a very , huge part of .
there 's research , to show up to <unk> percent of our food , certain foods we do n't there were if we do n't make bees have .
and that sounds , so <unk> , because it this is normal for us is , and we need bees might also not that it .
there 's now , some time also a very interesting movie , <unk> , to talk .
and i recommend you , look at it .
now , but look forward , the gentleman <unk> the universe is just with honeybees are working , in his high school , in <unk> the importance of bees , much power .
that he doing here at a school in <unk> and he 's going to us now some of his work to tell .
please , mr. <unk> .
yes , good evening .
first time a thank you , mr. <unk> and at the <unk> .
that i 'm here with my project , <unk> specifically <unk> something that you can think about that live in the bees .
and that still under one wing of <unk> about a little <unk> to tell that makes fun .
because i assume you can think that the most of you <unk> in fact , it was very well today at night a <unk> company , in eighteen minutes in the basics of beekeeping in order to .
that do i do n't , no .
but maybe you get it 's me , you to get you to these <unk> start to love or some kind of empathy to them to develop and you to go out for this <unk> youth-led , <unk> insect , the bee .
my name is thomas <unk> , i 'm <unk> years has 'm with a wonderful woman was married , father of five children still not <unk> and have different <unk> and <unk> finished and i 've been working <unk> years in the <unk> with <unk> adolescents and adults .
i 'm a member in <unk> <unk> and in charity <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
and work now in the <unk> <unk> top of <unk> with our oldest on the <unk> .
we 're working there in the garden , in agriculture and in beekeeping .
<unk> is yes , actually a play of <unk> <unk> and act of <unk> <unk> .
we 're flying classroom is to a <unk> , a quiet , a steady thing .
and she is also to calm .
it 's almost a <unk> issue .
and do n't have been the ancient greeks the relationship between the honey , so <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> know .
and in a wonderful verse of homer he describes how the <unk> <unk> his <unk> to the sleeping to go out to him to spark that it again , why do n't it .
but the <unk> go there was n't have to do , but they send their blue bees and <unk> now the poet , the lips , with the wax and they crawl in the mouth in , and out with him later , the words like the honey from the <unk> flow .
a beautiful picture .
hopefully you get me that evening .
yes .
this flying classroom .
i come to the project .
one of <unk> , this <unk> the just now my students with me , built have come for 30 kilometers until <unk> days in a <unk> .
in the neighboring schools of us in <unk> the school , or in the <unk> in the college of <unk> or in the <unk> after <unk> .
a <unk> after <unk> or in classrooms we had in <unk> .
the teacher , this project with this is going to me in the class , and we 're supposed to put in place for that in a <unk> .
most of the window to the children , that you can see during this month .
and of all things to the bees , then there are in the hose out and again <unk> can .
there is then the window of the slot , and created .
so .
and then starting to this with me on the <unk> .
i guess so a <unk> and <unk> ' right away from a term <unk> two <unk> out and <unk> you now here in these <unk> in .

it matters , we have here <unk> their , and here to the edge , fresh their , so fresh eggs .
and then you also a <unk> , up here .
there 's the honey is inside .
the need them , if a bad weather is , and do n't you can fly .
so .
that looks like then .
then there 's the <unk> here again on and immediately , the transportation of the for <unk> where , or the for <unk> place in school .
and now starting an amazing thing .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , these bees in there , then in the class at the experience of crisis .
their people 's not anymore .
they are lonely .
they find your queen 's not .
and this is the most important task from <unk> , when he showed this <unk> makes it to be paying attention to the queen sitting in the old people are left .
that is not so on these two <unk> sitting .
and they 're sad , these bees .
they 're beginning , <unk> .
yes , the <unk> says , they <unk> .
you hear that .
they just sums up almost a <unk> higher than if you normally in your <unk> with a queen 's coming together .
and now starting a <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , in one night , they develop all right now the necessity , a new people to , and the whole thing happened without <unk> , <unk> , without the conferences , without having , opinions and you .
here is the nation , agree and it then in the first night is a <unk> .
because without the queen going to this came after six weeks , they exist .
because <unk> lives only six weeks for .
so .
and the first night , get them from one of <unk> a out an egg , and bring that in this <unk> in .
and there <unk> to then you ai queen going .
everybody , of you <unk> in the high had to say , how to do that go ?
yes , genetically <unk> that 's all genetically <unk> .
this is true .
and now starting an amazing thing .
that is an egg , what 's normally in the <unk> an entirely unlike would have been going to the <unk> a queen .

and then it will be fed by a <unk> <unk> .
you know this term .
and instantly it changes , this <unk> on <unk> imagine the genetic code .
the <unk> going through the <unk> in the <unk> <unk> changed .
we had the earlier , time i heard that , what we eat , that determines , what of us will .
and in the queen 's really wonderful to see .
three days , egg , five days <unk> .
and that can the students all witness .
you see that in class .
and they will this cell <unk> with a <unk> wax and the whole thing happens then also not that , because that people right now that democratic to <unk> or because of <unk> says , so it going to be , you republican , a group , you do this now .
no , it happens <unk> .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , that 's a <unk> or a <unk> decision .
and then for the students to eight days of my graduate student knows , three five eight a queen 's doing so <unk> days that the queen <unk> .
and the day , if that and so happen to , the teacher , that wrote in the <unk> there <unk> the <unk> in the students in the five o'clock , yeah .
and then he says the mother , say , which is because with you go ?
yes , i got to the school .
yes , why that ?
yes , we 're the queen <unk> .
yeah ?
and then we are the morning to six in the school .
and then hit the to <unk> down here , <unk> , because you witness to , like the queen 's now <unk> .
and if you that really see that we can then you first thing .
the queen 's whistling .
so .
still a little bit higher .
and then get the <unk> and cut the queen going free .
the first what that the queen , they 're looking at their wings , and there are now , <unk> that people what to yourself a queen i pulled it has their own smell , you <unk> , their <unk> .
the nation has now again an identity .
now going to three or five days for the queen fed orally .
the <unk> front get them their <unk> <unk> .
the back from the they turn out , from the people of this <unk> .
and after five days going into the queen 's one of the <unk> out .
some think now , i 've been times in that 's a <unk> in <unk> .
, to stop .
what different .
-- that we let me .
the queen the flying now by ourselves without <unk> , without the guards , because of <unk> out to two miles high .
you have surely , time ever seen in your <unk> .
in the <unk> and is there in an <unk> now <unk> , of seven to 12 drones , the male bees .
so the way , as in islam , where the man different women have to this is the queen , the seven to 12 , men .
and the whole thing happening in a wonderful way in flight .
the drone could come back of <unk> the queen , and the queen of it now in an flight all this , what they 're going to seed need to for three years eggs to put them .
for the drone is it also an amazing experience .
if it 's done with the <unk> dies , and falls are the sky .
and then there 's the queen goes back and starts to lay eggs to put them .
it 's always a , two students in the class , it immediately see .
the also see immediately the queen .
yes .

and then come , i one evening , then you had to this <unk> .
<unk> ' that <unk> , though , and the next morning <unk> ' i 've got this <unk> with the queen and these bees to me on the <unk> .
and here you 're still the queen .
yes .
but then <unk> .
and around , most of 10 to 12 <unk> .
and then it 's this , these two <unk> are now here in a <unk> .
in a full cane , in a prey and now , that people the big and they 're going .
why bees in the school ?
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , the kids that have experienced , forget that never more .
yes .
there is yes , not just like that in this class , then the students all the time with the bees , , but the entire school , yes , in this class in .
and the teacher , when it 's something you know , when it 's something can , when he when he said , there something for it has the can a history , and after the other people .
look , bees and it ai n't a century ago <unk> years we have a cave paintings , where the people have been the honey and it .
a few months , in israel environment , years old <unk> found in which the people at the bees thought would have .
any human culture has with the bees , breakup .
or vice versa , the bees were in any culture .
in china , in india in persia , in egypt , in greece in rome .
all they were in .
the human cultures , i mean , ladies and gentlemen , are passed .
he can a <unk> , a <unk> hook , he can a <unk> join .
i mean , ladies and gentlemen , you know what kind of flowers , or the trees , the bees <unk> , what they need ?
it turned out there are now , and so find , now in summer in agriculture .
this out there , that 's a green desert for our bees .
yeah ?
he can find ourselves with the students in the gardening , and flowers are bees are able to the <unk> you mark and look , how long need the right away from <unk> to my kids flowers ?
how long , they 're on the individuals blooms ?
and how long , they need , until they come back .
he can ai <unk> hold .
how <unk> i a hexagon ?
yes .
so you know whether that 's so that in the <unk> the top , the top is , or it ai n't flat on the top is ?
look , right .
he can a math -- , a <unk> join .
yes , ladies and gentlemen , he can with the students , even the <unk> <unk> on these <unk> discover .
and then it comes to the question , was karl from newly <unk> the nobel prize in getting ?
because he thought , it has to the bees can see that in the beehive .
but , ladies and gentlemen , in a hive , it 's <unk> .
that 's also a bee has nothing .
and just the professor <unk> , many years in <unk> the university students , the , in <unk> figured that the bees , there a <unk> create the individual <unk> .
as a <unk> web of the wax into the <unk> a <unk> create , and now with <unk> hertz , their <unk> there , bid , and the bees , the <unk> , the up with their legs , with their <unk> .
you see what that bees in the school ?
it 's <unk> <unk> <unk> , and the kids lose your fear of bees .
and develop an awareness for the bees .
they learn , <unk> , look what the bees do .
and they get a aware of these creatures which in basically , just for us human lives .
the bees to wax still not a 70 pounds per people in the year .
ago <unk> years , the only way , candles make .
they accumulate the <unk> out of the trees that <unk> .
this is a <unk> , <unk> them their people .
and now you imagine the time ago , in summer , that their sixties , , <unk> bees on this one narrow the room , <unk> degrees .
hey , there 's the infectious diseases , without end .
no , in the bees do n't .
because they have in this <unk> natural antibiotics .
they accumulate the pollen , and so you to him <unk> , he 's about to <unk> , one being able <unk> .
someone , the <unk> have is , pneumonia <unk> , <unk> the can now to a <unk> go and a <unk> to make , and he the <unk> of the people <unk> .
obviously there 's a grid that , and with <unk> with a <unk> and so , because they do n't happen .
yes , and then i mean , ladies and gentlemen , of pollinating the <unk> do that the bees course , and we have a few apples , if the bees and there was n't fly would or we have to be like the chinese men 's the <unk> <unk> and they -- locally .
there 's much more to do .
you look at the <unk> , there on the meadow is also the growing on the <unk> , where the cows graze again .
and there 's going into the bee , then , the nectar and it 's fermented -- these <unk> .
and now comes the cow and <unk> the <unk> and just , because they <unk> <unk> pick up , they can digest .
yeah ?
and then <unk> you go back and notice , ah , yes , <unk> <unk> , ah , i can do it again <unk> .
and then there 's milk .
that makes the bee .
yeah ?
and to good end of those the bee 's most valuable , what it on the from the nature , there .
the honey .
i still just to the point to come <unk> .
my students to be happy , every year , if you this <unk> build and then you know , and with me together in the schools and go .
that 's now , not my <unk> but , i had a student , and i said in <unk> in school in <unk> and i said , you , <unk> , put you get yourself .
and then he says , yes , i get down , <unk> <unk> .
i come from <unk> in <unk> and i 'm 20 years .
and i 've been five years in <unk> and for two years , thomas in <unk> .
and i 'm ' me , now , with the <unk> learn to , but with the hands can learn .
<unk> , with the head .
and a <unk> went through the <unk> , <unk> school .
and more than half of said , oh yeah , we 're also .
my students see here are an appreciation and the place between , in quotes that normal and the those people get through the bees pick up .
the field to confront them , and they have confidence , my students and a proud .
how you going to the bee network ?
the question is wrong .
you have to say , you going to <unk> the <unk> ?
and what i think , i , there 's the human being the other people <unk> and he 's a new <unk> there .
and he says , so , start with this .
but at a poem from <unk> of <unk> .
who like the bee would be the sun across the <unk> feel the way to flower will find and never the direction , you lose the sides of the fields in <unk> glory of how quickly he also lived , he 'd ever do n't cry .
thank you .
hello , love her friends in god .
so welcome to show , my project .
this off my person and my wife .
it 's the fight for an end of the female she .
in my eyes the greatest crimes of humanity , because it their been five thousand years .
the society against the women , still have six to a day .
first <unk> ' i imagine .
my name is <unk> , i come from hamburg .
there , i <unk> years a <unk> .
and you can think that i was the job , not <unk> .
and i feel not <unk> .
and so i was glad to me in the subject <unk> well <unk> and exciting been cross the could .
for this .
with a massive <unk> about the news from africa , brazil .
the sail a plea on the <unk> brazil , for the genocide in the last live indians the <unk> , to stop .
that was a ride , where i more <unk> was as <unk> , more <unk> as <unk> .
yet we were these large amounts of that , that interest in the media to find and even a person like i was his cause global in the language into .
<unk> i started with their own caravan across the <unk> in ethiopia <unk> .
then there 's where war between eritrea , and ethiopia and we were <unk> of the killings in there .
and despite all the cruelty , we were experiencing , we experienced the other side of the infinity hospitality of <unk> , into <unk> , arab hospitality .
and once it was that we busted , and our two guards , you see here , with their bodies as living took of us <unk> , and the <unk> said that are my an environment .
if you the killing you want you by us through it shoot .
something similar , i know , not another culture .
and then in boys years , i 've learned that you islam , it can reduce the terrorism .
and christians , yes , not reduced to be on their terrorism .
for the <unk> .
the -- that <unk> .
but rather on the real value , how to charity , social responsibility that <unk> .
these are the values , for the , it 's worthwhile to fight .
after many years , i came back in this <unk> been , with my wife <unk> .
and there were we then , from this <unk> female-pattern and she .
when i then i heard that <unk> percent of everyday victims <unk> are the rest of these christians and <unk> . i ' i thought about how can a <unk> like that islam the next to all of terror , that still <unk> in the shoes , it 's ?
and the idea was the highest in africa of islam to the need to sin to understand .
we 're looking for in the germans organizations that we have n't find it .
because we had to us , then hear that now we would be yes , completely <unk> , of islam is n't <unk> .
you would i the throat ribbons .
on <unk> of amnesty , international then we have <unk> our own organization , started .
and they were kind of <unk> and <unk> independently .
and to now this battle , even get to , we needed the images .
it was a scarcity .
and so moved <unk> and i went back in this desert to do with the hidden camera these images to do .
the bad as a bloody pictures that i show you do n't , but i want to the crime out .
girl , the age of four weeks to the wedding be some of their parents and family , picked , the planet , put it 's going to the limbs , and cutting them without anesthesia , the clitoris and the <unk> go up with a <unk> the <unk> , without anesthesia , <unk> instruments , you have of hygiene , and the anatomy and the <unk> to attenuate this .
what you left is a small aperture of the size of <unk> .
for a minuscule part , a 15 minutes .
if they typically get ask him to do these two weeks .
never even in the body and soul , <unk> their dignity .
that was the beginning of so-called <unk> <unk> .
in the virgins 's on .
the man to open it .
he still has never a <unk> she saw .
the uncle , he said , oh , ibrahim that 's no problem .
you 're rubbing your penis , <unk> , and then one or you very hard by .
and if you do n't it says , is also not bad .
then take you that knife and <unk> them on .
this is <unk> <unk> .
and dies a third of the girl .
that you had three months ago for .
in shock , the girl puts his language .
these are the <unk> , also some in asia .
the most are <unk> does .
and when , we are muslims were , why you did this ?
i was the <unk> answer that we need to do that 's in the koran .
nothing is in the koran , quite the opposite .
everyone , believing <unk> times per day in prayer , one <unk> , the creator , is , perfectly , <unk> .
but they do n't seem to believe , what they were there praying .
they imply <unk> , a <unk> to be the women being created , and so , well as <unk> person having could produce , women <unk> .
but now we had the pictures of the first collaborator was this <unk> .
he <unk> us , his whole <unk> <unk> to a conference .
there 's hard discussions , for two days .
but we had the minister in our side , the highest <unk> on our side .
and the thing that , the practice is against all rights , the power to religion , we need to him one .
as recently that has the way <unk> this new <unk> signed .
and if you africa and the <unk> know , you know , just that has to these people are valid .
and it was celebrating , and these successes , we had actually , in other countries .
quick example , <unk> there <unk> us the highest spiritual , the <unk> the country , his message that 's a crime is , on <unk> to write and that now in the <unk> to wear .
for weeks , we were the way , with your <unk> .
a hundred <unk> we had in .
and where we came , we 've just open your ears , open arms and the historical , saints hospitality , you know .
and when we do this country , eventually leaving to said the big scholar and <unk> <unk> , you want to really all <unk> countries to happen ?
so much lifetime will <unk> you , there .
he 's right .
i 'm <unk> and i mean , slow to it coming .
and so , he had an idea .
he said , if you get the ten <unk> muslims , the world , a table to come and the reason for the need to sin , then it 's a sin .
<unk> and i flew in cairo , in the <unk> and -- the mosque to do with the vatican , the <unk> .
and the <unk> for <unk> quite the <unk> , <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> we got a <unk> .
he heard the idea , was thrilled , , when we took him since , that we pay you .
and that we do it 's about the funders , support .
and then he said , i 'm going to the conference , not just <unk> , we 're going to being asked had , but i 'm going to the <unk> take .
and that he has done .
over cairo <unk> at the years <unk> our government transparent .
international <unk> , on the <unk> the female body through l.a. cut .
the <unk> the <unk> professor , doctor , ali <unk> .
and all these are they did .
a hundred guards , but the highest in the world .
in the middle <unk> of qatar , the man has <unk> in hamburg , and the rest of europe , he 's the cause of <unk> because of cartoons .
so men the life and death can decide .
but it 's also the other .
the left the <unk> <unk> , right , the <unk> , my <unk> .

and then you for <unk> your film to show <unk> .
reality .
the men had wet eyes .
they were doing the back behind <unk> doors , only two hours , you had decided , and a <unk> wrote , a <unk> .
the <unk> kick the cameras , announced , what you decided it .
and the most important set it , that was this .
female she 's a <unk> crime , against the highest values of islam and it .
he 's an autograph the <unk> .
we thought , the job is done had , but the calculation , without our <unk> done .
because the shame , over the abdomen , the woman to talk , is more of them than any mind .
so we <unk> .
we have that we have the conference , documented in this so-called `` golden rule book .
a <unk> for the <unk> this world .
and because ali <unk> , the <unk> , it so well , i found that book , he 's a preamble blessed .
it gets us from the hands out .
we were in many countries had then conferences , hold of the top of the highest <unk> .
and they read that with interest in some were so thrilled that it 's book <unk> have .
unfortunately , but we have the most not the courage to put that well , to announce that .
over the abdomen , the woman you 're not in the mosque to talk .
just some of the courage to put this .
they 're at least in the universities , you go , on <unk> .
and sometimes we have a bold <unk> found the fact , in the mosque about <unk> , like here .
and then it out of speakers in the <unk> .
and that are , the individuals .
the will it spread .
but i 'm going out of time .
it are all of the hot rocks , and so i work , many other strategy , this topic , <unk> .
the practice of arguments that .
but my <unk> that would this .
i want to the great message the highest <unk> the world telling the birthplace of islam , which is the kaaba , in mecca .
not , so <unk> <unk> <unk> , but in the <unk> .
if there 's four million people come together , men and women <unk> islamic currents .
then <unk> ' i do with all that and the <unk> king of my transparent up there between the minarets if you .
like this . been a trained to have in the <unk> .
unfortunately i 've not only , the last <unk> , that would be the <unk> king .
but i 'm sure , when he said of <unk> he would join .
, to these women to help .
for other to the time to show , which the real value of islam , instead of the time to demonstrate to them .
from terrorists than <unk> .
if i do n't that do then <unk> ' i might this , in hamburg , launching a negative .
that at least a lot <unk> in the mosques up in god .
and we transparent , if you will be .
and maybe i experience i do it , that little girl puts his daughters , <unk> to .
then , my life that 's worth it .
and i appeal , every , now it has seen or , to join .
also not join this has been a <unk> .
we need to the practice in the at a step , you learn and i 'm here of this stage , not .
and now i want to conclude the concept of my <unk> , even show .
this is my <unk> , <unk> .

down there we have it , in german .
female she 's with the koran , and the ethic of islam , incompatible .
it 's <unk> and one of discrimination of islam .
thank you .
thank you .
so , i 'm actually , so that time .
so we looked at the <unk> from that you a refugee , in germany would get .
the <unk> attention <unk> have my mother , my brother and i the first time as a package <unk> .
it made <unk> .
my mom was completely terrified , because they did n't understand , why the us now rotten food have given .
the third day , we finally i resolved .
we were the trash to say , again , throw away then came a <unk> wife and those that easy to <unk> .
they tried to us to explain , hey , that you can eat .
that 's not , well .
that tastes , very well .
it 's the cheese .
my mother was the eyebrows , and we were laughing .
cheese .
in my country , we have a <unk> but the has not so <unk> smell .
i 'm <unk> <unk> and <unk> years old .
in fifteen years , i came to my mother and my brother of china , germany , and fled .
this kind of escape <unk> ' i went to tell .
but , it 's going to me about the people that cause to happen to have and to a success did .
but first , tell , i 'm going to where , i 'm from .
i 'm <unk> .
<unk> are a little <unk> , the northwest of china life .
and this region is the chinese that would be in <unk> called .
it 's about <unk> miles from germany away .
in china to live in 10 million <unk> but in munich , is the <unk> community of china .
and these <unk> life , so here because we in china under constant , human rights have to .
hundreds of chinese were trying to get after <unk> moved so we in our own home to a sizable minority and you are .
our own native language , <unk> was the education is basically .
in schools and in university will only still in chinese students .
and our religion can we also not free to act .
the <unk> losing so their culture and identity .
and if , someone with this is , and for the right to the <unk> in the risk of sentences , torture , or even die .
that was also the reason , why my parents , and i decided , with us kids to escape .
that was <unk> and i was 11 years old .
this picture is a moment ago , our escape from .
we did n't enough money , so my father had first time behind .
i <unk> ' me , many people , in the longing to have helped .
i <unk> ' me , many images .
i <unk> ' me , but first , <unk> our <unk> <unk> .
i just know , it right , me , when i my eyes <unk> .
he was big had an ai <unk> , , and we met him , with his little <unk> on a lot .
the first rate was going to pass .
i know that many a negative image of <unk> have to the only do business plan to refugees abuse , not for the fates to care .
but i '' , say , '' , it as <unk> call , not as <unk> .
because <unk> has us for months of .
he was the airport in <unk> on a <unk> and has to the last thing <unk> , whether we also really sure , through the <unk> up .
airport in <unk> we came , and i know , as my mother to somehow i said that 's just turned out of the airport .
turns out to you 're not to .
until we are out .
because i had , in my hand , along and there was also my photo in but there was a total stranger name , <unk> .
i had a <unk> through the <unk> .
and i <unk> ' at me <unk> <unk> the me at he had my watch out in my hand .
silence .
and sweat .
a long view .
we have finally <unk> .
in munich , came <unk> ' i look at a lot of the first responders , somehow , which have .
i <unk> ' me of the <unk> woman , with us in <unk> used by .
in a <unk> with four <unk> per <unk> 13 family .
at least for children .
a <unk> and a kitchen .
it was stranger who 's faces .
and many different languages .
and we did n't have privacy .
my mother , my brother and i had to us a <unk> share .
there was eating , you 've made and homework done .

just mean <unk> the <unk> in college , i knew them .
they knew my story and we went to me , and they took care , to me .
for example , got them to me <unk> <unk> what i now , i do .
but it helped me , somehow , the kids were able to meet .
i spent my whole puberty , in <unk> .
that was for my mother 's not easy .
alone with us kids , her husband and always in the uncertainty , because we had yes , just a <unk> and we could have any <unk> be .
i <unk> ' me that i very , aggressively , the time .
it 's me also slightly embarrassing , this now here 's all to tell , but now i must be easy to my story on .
i was really aggressive and i could tell me in the school at some way to focus .
that brought us to find out to the catholic <unk> where we the first time with a regular school kids in touch were coming .
with a normal , my goodness ' i children , not in a <unk> , had .
i <unk> ' i was also , the <unk> the me and my brother and so , or <unk> sent to have .
just so we bit out .
i <unk> ' i was also , several <unk> <unk> the bit of homework done , because our parents do n't speak german , could .
or the have to us just made it .
we 've always very excited .
i know , how we always the big fence line up and waited until these people came , because , it took the stranger who created for us , and that was telling us at the important .
after two years , finally got my father , germany .
the problem , but that it directly from <unk> after <unk> <unk> was because it in munich , whereas the no room , for him , there .
i <unk> ' me of the very , who she said that i did it , my father of the <unk> after china to keep us they made it even that he we had in munich , for .
i <unk> ' at me this time where i really , and then , really happy , because after six years <unk> to do we finally in a normal place to draw .
we got a <unk> for three years , and we had finally one of your own apartment , own bathroom , and one of your kitchen .
and i had actually a room .
it was a very small and i did n't have desk in , but it was good , i was my door in -- .
and i <unk> ' me that i the time , very well used to have , but i had yet the college , without a school , and leave .
i looked for me really no way .
there was a <unk> to me in <unk> , which has and it still do with the idea that i think about the second and exposing , my degrees <unk> can .
first <unk> then the <unk> .
i thank the teacher , really , i thought , and i was really not easy to the time he managed to leave it 's actually going to the middle at that .
and i started to <unk> .
and before i started to <unk> and i played the way with my best friend <unk> in <unk> .
<unk> is an organization or a project of organized <unk> .
but i was n't a <unk> that i ' i also only done because we go through <unk> a place had , where we simply could go .
we had a valve , what we <unk> <unk> could .
and the heads of <unk> helped us some way that we are able to tell you could and he went to us and i could tell us in all these somehow help .
and then i came to <unk> , <unk> .
and that 's a project , where young people without a major in the opportunity to get , the artistic <unk> .
that 's what i really very well done , and i was , art is something which i was also slightly <unk> .
by <unk> and the connect to <unk> was a filmmaker , on us .
he made the movie <unk> about the lives of my friends and me .
and the film he won lots of prices .
we realized that the people , for our story was interested .
he was a very special feeling , because we do it 's still never experienced was that people we were listening .
and that was like a moment , where i thought , okay .
i want , they did n't .
i mean anything from my life .
a collaborator of <unk> , a <unk> for refugees , came to me on the idea for a <unk> of the <unk> <unk> to join .
but because i put in the bold building me completely lost , i ended up to be held in <unk> for a play and the title is <unk> one to four .
so i was right .
i was playing with .
and the cool thing is , after a performance of two editors , from <unk> broadcasting on me <unk> .
and i had asked , if i do have just let 's own <unk> to do .
i thought , super , the golden rule .
i realized i do , i do with .
and i made for the radio <unk> , pulse <unk> and one of posts about a play <unk> , i also ourselves <unk> was for the european <unk> nominated vice versa .
and i told him , actually won .
now coming up to the school for <unk> and movie munich <unk> , the third year , and i 'm <unk> the <unk> .
and all this would have to me to do n't been possible if not one or organizations like <unk> or projects like <unk> well , for me , used to have .
they have to me , we did you have to me spaces open , they have to me ways that , i my place in society me <unk> can .
and to come , i now to them .
each of you have the way of people like to help second chance to get and their lives or their place in society to find .
because that people , every day come to shrink a hundred million refugees in munich , and each of you 're with hope and each of you have a huge potential .
they have it with great and determination to many terrible is behind , to them .
and with this determination , you could really big for profit for germany , and for every one of us too .
and i could actually get things to tell you can do , but because i do n't no longer enough time you have even though there it , a minute , the world , i you a <unk> brought .
whip them now your out they ca n't tell me tell you to no code <unk> can .
then scan it the code , and then they come on the side of <unk> with many possibilities , what they have no way we can do .
and that would allow us all right to help .
i thank me already now time for their engagement and we look out hope .
and then scan it the code .
i just know , it .
many have the phone , not in my hand .
you so i 'm going to become , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
<unk> yes .
just a <unk> <unk> was .
forward to me to connect to have .
my name is a robin .
my <unk> is write , simpler than it talks .
i come , of austria , that 's in vienna .
i 'm ' me , yet , today in <unk> to attend that 's really beautiful here .
i <unk> me here every time , very comfortable .
and that 's not a phrase , that 's a sense .
yes , in contrast to the other <unk> i 'm not here today to you about anything to <unk> .
i was n't , about .
but it 's so , they said that i write in my spare time and then some talk , mostly in <unk> <unk> or <unk> or just <unk> like the world today .
yes , and i was also today i asked , here 's a couple of text to read the image of the program a little <unk> .
and the wind ' i 'm going to do here .
yes .
i start with a joke .
they meet the two million chickens .
and says that one , are two english , chickens and i <unk> you and <unk> so not <unk> , but <unk> been a very funny . i <unk> you and <unk> are <unk> <unk> in <unk> .
and says that , yeah .
hey , and just ca n't <unk> me .
here we have the level of particles are .
the first text is a little <unk> that i time i wrote was .
i , it at a person is devoted to me , and what has .
it carries the <unk> .
and yes , it at themselves do n't understand .
when your head in my lap , we slept under your rest of my ceiling .
my leg was also under my ceiling , your leg that we look outside the ceiling .
my leg that we look for the ceiling .
it 's about her head is , on my lap , dear , the rest of her the ceiling , my leg , under the ceiling , her leg of the ceiling .
that has <unk> , as if only my leg is extremely long .
it was very romantic .
the text , i also at a person is devoted to me very much means .
and that my grandpa owned .
we 've ever since no contact with more .
my <unk> grandfather was from a butcher paper .
and as a child has it with love , drawing cut .
me about that , yeah .
yes , 'n text .
it will be able to do n't .
jesus is the only , their is the sticker , the glass of the bus .
but where i was , jesus as he told me , that sticker <unk> , save us to ?
there to think , yeah ?
i mean <unk> been brought ?
soon the text .
the text is a little bit more .
he takes a half hours .
so to write .
and read it faster .
is beginning of a novel that i degrees in the <unk> write .
ah , it 's about <unk> guys , so the adventures , one guy , and around the hair them and a little too <unk> .
i <unk> ' me , but again and here , in front of the hallmark to distance .
because i '' ' i 'm never the hair dyed .
chapter one .
if i <unk> is my head , empty .
so who looks like the sheet , that he now to fill it .
yes , i 'm not come .
very hard half hours .
the text is also a little <unk> .
most people do n't .
i do , i think about ourselves too hard .
and that 's the , i play , like with my own lexicon , and with my language .
i , always been to me .
and yes , then come , these things out .
it carries the <unk> .
is a little bit strange yet <unk> .
is probably the <unk> <unk> that i ever been writing . i .
<unk> we can .
yes , we dosage .
we all can .
we <unk> .
but i ca n't .
but i can do it .
i can not .
i can not .
yes , , that 's putting yourself also not understand .
no idea .
yes , you clap of me .
i say , always , either of divinity or no .
the next sheet , has also do with text to do .
it 's like a little <unk> .
i ' at the time for the insects and writing .
very polite .
yes , 'n text .
is a little <unk> .
and that 's about how cool , when i was so i go to her three to tell you might be .
my text is the title , all good things are really cool .
<unk> <unk> is <unk> so dry .
<unk> we meet the <unk> .
so to stroke , <unk> , <unk> and from scratch and they will also , better and yes , that 's it .
now managing the moment .
yes , 'n <unk> , this is this a different .
and that 's about how cool , when i was so i go , that we all this ai kind <unk> could do , so 'n . we that all time .
alright , so , what the wind power , .
the wearing the <unk> and about this .
yes .
this is fun , you .
the <unk> text is just a sentence .
i write , so like little <unk> .
this is a visualize sexual off .
sexual desire to <unk> -- writing .
<unk> s ?
yes , yeah .
this is fun , you .
yes , 'n sentence .
the is in <unk> written .
is a very long sentence .
i think it 's almost impossible , <unk> in <unk> to explain this is the point .
here , text .
this day is a <unk> .
is the title of the text .
this day is a <unk> and he knows it .
it 's already know , before i do it as such <unk> have .
it 's got me <unk> of just fell , then i would he told me <unk> .
i could me later , in him <unk> .
i was to the joy .
it as <unk> ago all other days <unk> and me back to sleep we put it .
with a <unk> <unk> the face where else ?
and purpose , it , to honor , by i <unk> .
and should i later , back up , it 's able to do n't need to a going day traded .
there hope , right ?
now it 's time for a joke .
what i said to albert einstein , when he would be a steak , she liked ?
i q .
so .
the letter q sounds like the cow .
it 's why this funny .
yes , the text , has also the middle of her .
this is more what political .
so , i write , not just fun things .
i write , also partially a lot of .
and that 's wind ' i often wondered , where i <unk> .
and , there was , i just this text is written .
he carries the <unk> .
my dad came from vienna , in my mother and i 'm from her .
yes .
we have the <unk> .
thank you for the sound .
yes , this in , '' ' i 'd like a bit of advertising .
i ca n't business or so afford , so i have to that always <unk> do .
and that <unk> ' i also ourselves up and i ended up , also have a <unk> <unk> in vienna .
you can to let me show up .
and yes , i <unk> , i <unk> , actually very <unk> .
and , yeah .
that you want , ' i just have said .
it goes on the program .
more .
this is a little advertising , i time i wrote was .
feet .
the realm of vitamin c .
so the <unk> .
vitamin a toe .
already have a very funny .
i want , a joke about the <unk> your friend of writing , but that punchline was just the flat .
yes , is not been on my <unk> .

yes .
thank you for a 's listening .
you were terrific .
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .
let me tell you 'll begin with a <unk> question to start .
why would you <unk> actually do ?
i mean , everybody , the tax used to the questions , whether it at least some potentially of society , what you back .
the answer is clear .
we know now , the life expectancy for at the birth , just to about <unk> percent of genetically <unk> is .
it 's subject to any of environmental , <unk> give the impact on <unk> have .
why we know it still so little ?
why are we were bombarded by <unk> messages from the <unk> , the part of each other on ?
you remember , all of fifteen years to the guilty .
it was fat .
you thought , if you fat from the food , we , we all have to be healthy old .
what the <unk> of <unk> <unk> shelves , with different <unk> in the way the has led and what does it has changed the americans every year 's become are .
then you have said , ah , no .
but not the fat .
it are the carbs .
now what to <unk> like the <unk> the <unk> , the <unk> and so has led .
it 's so , and it ai new <unk> hurdle , through a 's a village <unk> .
where the whole <unk> ?
now , the reason is , for my taste of rice at least that we go through <unk> <unk> approaches anecdotal isolated to the science and wisdom <unk> .
sort of a <unk> alone is here .
the <unk> you know of all .
<unk> published a lot <unk> know , a new <unk> .
the top <unk> the <unk> <unk> for the next year .
keith richards , was seven years for the number one nominated vice versa .
then , the newspaper .
or this lady here .
jean <unk> .
the oldest one person , shows ever attempted on the earth has lived .
<unk> years old .
i know , there 's some people to say , they are six , can but just your <unk> n't find .
jean <unk> is actually <unk> become .
and they stopped with <unk> on to smoke started , but with <unk> , and then finally , <unk> <unk> the path of the great to follow and stop to smoke .
with <unk> is then they died .
what that tell us ?
not enough of cigarettes , healthy .
but it tells us , aging , very complicated is , and that we -- what we need to an experimental systems and we need to just might ask questions .
ai n't quite simple question , and a very simple issue , in different countries , preserved , is women are older than men .
what is that ?
we know it 's now .
this is the testosterone , <unk> so , what the male <unk> by 2027 .
and there 's <unk> one very evidence for <unk> men are just as old women .
you can now everybody for , think if that 's a <unk> <unk> is .
austria 's a free land .
but it are still better tips , not afraid .
general , should we 've correlation , <unk> to confuse morality .
sounds complicated , but it 's just the usual <unk> to illustrate .
there , so someone ai <unk> grandma , and asks , what they have , because so different done or else had to keep them that old become are ?
ah .
that she has a day every decade of cigarettes , down .
this is the secret of their ages , right ?


even being statistics are not always <unk> .
there for example , ai n't very hard , that shows that people that <unk> in the <unk> to get older , when people that do n't do this .
do .
is <unk> .
is that from the <unk> <unk> ?
no .
it 's because that the people just enough money in the bag have to the good to her age and the <unk> of them to take care .
if i but a bunch of animals a <unk> to forage and give them and this group with 20 percent live longer than it ai to a group of the <unk> 's not get , but otherwise , the exact same way that was then i actually probably a <unk> factor in the diet by .
and actually are these attempts been made .
to tell you , the <unk> is very -- at , but even i do with my enemies agree , is , the twin said that live up .
and this works for the different organisms .
for example , bacteria .
you see here , ai <unk> of bacteria .
if we the fast , in the <unk> line showing you live in the much longer .
the same thing for <unk> , <unk> flying over mice and recently was only ago about two years in the u.s. that 's even for the monkey is true .
and let 's not about , skinny .
it 's too , <unk> the <unk> kitchen .
and that 's a another experiment , what the united states has been done .
what , you did here ?
it ai <unk> and has one of this so-called <unk> to , a <unk> diet , where you so many <unk> this day and night get depressed .
and who you wonder , that they 're dick became , sick and have an ai n't very bad <unk> had and bad <unk> .
now , you ai in common with <unk> and that has the right in the same amount of <unk> looking at the only that in the ai n't break .
the have the day , thinking about food to , for you have at twice as much eating .
and these <unk> now is not have and healthy and they also has no <unk> .
despite having both animals <unk> is feeding were .
both have a much eating .
the a sick and the other healthy .
so what happens is really ?
it 's a process called cellular <unk> or <unk> on .
when , they were organisms , or will take food taken away then it starts to the organism , redundant ingredients in the cell or those compounds our to take it again , energy to do .
that makes sense .
and that looks like this .
you can see , in the cell , it , <unk> form of to junk , the ages <unk> .
the <unk> then with the stomach that 's going <unk> and the cell as energy back to put them .
it 'll leave you damage the age , accumulate in the limits on .
this is about the molecular <unk> the <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> often tell .
so , to it so twin said , they spread that live in different organisms .
and it 's likely to take that 's also in people work .
and we learn from this is that it 's not like in <unk> recommended , every little <unk> the day with two <unk> fight to .
no .
but , they should have to say , if you 're hungry , ah , perhaps is under the <unk> on .
welcome you your hunger , as a friend .
and it 's also <unk> sense .
while <unk> had nine nine percent of the history has the human being what did , if he was hungry , had ?
alright , he is to go .
we go out of the fridge , hunting , if we 're hungry .
and that 's safe to the biology .
now we know , and that 's already in the bible , in <unk> chapter <unk> verse <unk> , the mind is : , but the meat is weak .
the garden , look for us very different from .

the three guys here 's good , the food , all day , let , service .
and that 's sort of the actual <unk> .
we looked so on the quest for all made the molecular answer the <unk> turn , despite the organism to eat .
this could for people to be interesting about to <unk> not enough just <unk> <unk> <unk> .
and it could we might , one of the hardest <unk> of life to preserve .
the question is so that we can <unk> , the <unk> , the cellular <unk> turn , although you eat ?
and we have a hundred , the thousands of all scans , will get .
we did in a found that means <unk> .
<unk> is a solid substance , in all of organisms , naturally does the but also in all of organisms , during the halt even less will .
in your skin , it 's the <unk> .
<unk> people have been much less <unk> in your skin as <unk> .
and if we now <unk> on human cells , there for example , then you see here .
this is an ai is cell , here .
is the <unk> , the nucleus , we give <unk> on and we see many thousands of these little <unk> in the cell of the junk , the ages <unk> , <unk> .
<unk> cells were very , just like this .
and this works in different organisms .
here for example , shown on a <unk> .
so we ai substance , and the molecular <unk> <unk> the <unk> .
life , because the organisms that too much .
and the answer is again , you see here , ai typical <unk> of <unk> .
it are simple <unk> .
after <unk> days , the all dead , it 's the days is about half the dead .
when , we <unk> the water , there , here in colorful characters are the animals grow and surviving better .
we also know that human cells that we of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> have in culture , about three times as long to survive , if we do you with <unk> put themselves .
and the latest research , we put too close that even the lives of all over mice , <unk> up will .
and it 's not only that life , it 's also the <unk> .
these mice are clearly <unk> .
so .
now you want to say , all know , where is <unk> ago ?
how the name is already says , it 's the sperm being discovered was , you get it in very high concentrations .
but i can you comforting , in <unk> fresh green and pepper mushrooms cheese , and a product of <unk> <unk> , which in japan , <unk> firstly , it 's <unk> <unk> 's very much <unk> ago .
we then , if <unk> against <unk> helps , by it the junk <unk> it then you may also , <unk> ?
they have to find is to know , the common point of all <unk> diseases is that during the ages <unk> in the brain <unk> .
and we did in experiments that made .
they 're going to be wondering , we have the edges of flies .
man that will see , <unk> , if you old .
they have more <unk> in the brain , if you old .
and the molecular mechanisms to the memory of these are very much like the people .
now you ask , yet , how to the devil has the fellow the memory of flies -- ?
this is the experiment , what we share with stefan seals from the university in berlin did .
you take a fruit flies and on the here , there are a target smell , they love .
<unk> .
and let the project in this <unk> <unk> .
then they take the same fly to give them in the next chamber , and give you <unk> different smell , they love , which <unk> .
we do you make the <unk> enjoy , but if you ai <unk> <unk> .
the classic <unk> .
then take them back the same fly to do the here in .
the driving this degree in the <unk> down , there you that .
and if you have here , which are going to give them from the one side <unk> and of other side <unk> this .
where we go into the all about to do ?
it .
the <unk> .
except the wonderful here .
these are the <unk> .
or , we say , they have a character .
i love my <unk> and i want , i 'm not by this ai <unk> reward , corrupt .
okay .
this is , but it ai n't form of character , with the age increases .
not just to fly .
and we could actually the <unk> the fly through <unk> on a <unk> , on a <unk> , and back into .
and the <unk> , in the brain that were , were back the ground .
i mean , <unk> does n't just to , and aging , but also , <unk> diseases , maybe some .
and that 's important , because we want yes , the <unk> not the lifespan , se extend .
it does n't make sense , the era of <unk> to extend .
and i want you do n't putting them , without them , a few practical , tips , to do we 're some younger .
, <unk> fast .
it 's not about that you weight on or so .
there 's the way that now in austria ai group of <unk> people , a day to eat and a day , do n't eat .

and the the very well , through .
i mean , it 's <unk> .
and avoid them <unk> .
it 's not about carbs , complex carbs seem to do n't be dangerous . .
it 's really to take candy .
you know now that <unk> burst , to get diabetes in , even then if you have are .
and you know , that sugar the growth of tumors , if it can .
here you ai <unk> , the ago , the ages .
after 30 days , the all dead .
very low doses of glucose rich .
to a <unk> effect to create .
there 's just an example , that works in almost all of organisms that .
food they regularly fruit and vegetables .
and avoid them the gift of a lot <unk> or of <unk> all .
you know now that <unk> -- and <unk> cancer can now .
this is not under conditions for them vitamin d .
we 're here maybe some degrees ' in winter , <unk> , because vitamin d is by sunlight on the skin is building .
in some of them at least three times per week , ai half hour of sports , it 's very trivial .
cigarettes , despite the bet <unk> examples of them <unk> 10 to fifteen years lifetime .
do you , in times the eternal <unk> occasionally the peace .
the impact of praying , and blood pressure on the life expectancy is to .
because the monks in almost as long , how women .
<unk> , <unk> <unk> to live longer than <unk> .
<unk> live longer than <unk> .
but <unk> lives are still no longer than <unk> .
just <unk> die , sooner than <unk> .
what is that ?
the people assume that has to engage with some get to do .
no way , no way that 's very simple .
if now here 's a <unk> the window is then <unk> ' i the with <unk> <unk> answer either way .
and what 's like that 's probably in her around .
<unk> them , <unk> and so what , going through to get under conditions there <unk> .
so , alcohol , ai <unk> effect .
a permanent partner , or ai family , longevity is associated with .
they should n't look at a lot of the busiest streets you live .
now if you see the same <unk> .
that , but with <unk> n't have to do .
it 's about <unk> .
you can measure the closer to someone at a lot of the busiest streets lives , you cut more <unk> he 's the blood .
and that 's , when he says , i they were used .
i can already well sleep and the noise , i do n't .
not true .
he 's still more <unk> in the blood and that 's bad .
the sunlight that could be because <unk> course .
we know now that <unk> very good metabolic effects .
so , it 's the <unk> down .
and we also know that <unk> and <unk> mice , you 're infectious to protect .
knew that way our grandmothers will also been the us with <unk> and so <unk> have .
it 's not without any sense .
many studies of evidence that dark chocolate , dementia <unk> do it .
just recently is a study with that has shown that there ai n't totally panel of dark chocolate , a day , the <unk> of <unk> on the level of <unk> can make .
kind of what you of coffee there 's the , looking at it thinner .
there 's trials , that show , there 's studies that 's not show .
what 's clear , this is that coffee , diabetes <unk> it and their metabolic performance better .
and a coffee is actually also a good <unk> because he solves <unk> , how we share with <unk> <unk> of paris to show you could .
ai n't very nice and intricate study in the hundred thousand people to fifteen years long , where they were have shown that people that every day , ai handful of nuts and eat their <unk> to 20 percent mortality down .
this is a huge value for the ai <unk> study .
and this is for <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> .
but not for the peanuts , the <unk> seen , beans .
the give just , by it and nuts call , okay ?
that are , but actually , beans .
so for the peanuts and so is not .
the next thing is a little bit .
and avoid them the shot of of animal protein , so of meat and dairy , when you between <unk> and <unk> years old .
ai n't very beautiful new study shows that you , if you in this time of animal protein to to take you <unk> so strong , increase , as if you a strong smokers , be .
this is not for the time , where the animal protein , well , and it 's true of course not for <unk> children or at the animal protein need and it 's not for pregnant and such that 's going to .
generally not do you <unk> .
what that they do to remain they <unk> know that , friedrich nietzsche that has said , the objection to the <unk> , a happy or actually the <unk> are signs of the health .
everything <unk> heard in the pathology lab .
this is the gentleman <unk> <unk> the has about after that regime that lived and he 's <unk> years old .
it out of my home <unk> of the <unk> , is never get sick .
and he 's very well .
he 's just not <unk> as not an anecdote , but he lives in a <unk> , where it in a lot of healthy <unk> there .
it 's about the <unk> followed that i do you today i 've gone .
we should look at all the <unk> way it ai n't important fact , not only overlook .
which is that <unk> the halt , i 've not organic , but a social seems to be , and so eventually a -- .
you <unk> the old people less , and that could one of the <unk> of our culture .
<unk> wrote the novel , the <unk> a year ago , he died .
the brothers <unk> .
a piece is the contemporary critic , the adolescents and fresh <unk> .
thank you to for your attention .
i want to start with a question , i 'm here .
a question , where now , no up to , because that 's a little <unk> is those who of them is very lonely ?
the output 's very low .
fact , when i thought .
it , but probably the reasons , why do n't who have , the people that for , which is quite <unk> would .
many people confuse <unk> and loneliness and think that would <unk> .
and it 's not at all the case .
you 'll see , and loneliness is actually a phenomenon , people than just straightforward .
maybe it 's because it also that they 're not reported , because the question here 's put it .
like to be the lonely , or is you very lonely ?
you can , lonely , feel anything , lonely .
and you can be lonely be no , in the moment lonely , to feel .
one has also a lot of shame , to do .
and that 's some now here from have , and loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness is in the shame and realize that in one .
one takes time .
also why is , now here , nobody who have the past few seconds , which i do you 've got .
and loneliness to <unk> .
and loneliness to the time to the edge of all aware enough to be .
and loneliness to also practice to talk about being able to .
and this exercise to have we all do n't .
we have neither the language , we have any sign of ourselves to recognize when we are lonely ?
there 's the one two <unk> , which i and so i 'm .
the one part of humanity , you is from beginning of lonely .
the birth to death is you just really lonely .
there 's a few moments in life where you that <unk> can .
these people go and often to <unk> and turns into the whole day .
i ' no time , is so you <unk> .
and then there 's people might be less country , say , everything is with all connected .
that i think there 's not actually , so , i 's just a part of the big universe .
and there 's the great group , to the and i am the time , so , time thinking that .
the thinking , okay , today i a lonely and the next day , oh , it 's all together .
if we of loneliness to think it 's always begin with the very big one of a .
the one of dying , the one of the person on an icu .
but about this <unk> , about these big <unk> <unk> ' what i do n't talk , but i want to talk about the small , over the everyday <unk> , where one of us , like a theater to make it .
i want to do n't talk about the burden , and <unk> the <unk> .
one in other to realize it 's mostly , not difficult one of us to <unk> already .
the photographer christine tailors , the break a few pictures made that i show you want .
how easy it 's always falls , in other , and loneliness to detect .
and we all know , not , whether these people , really in this moment lonely felt .
but who knows it 's not , the moment , so <unk> event , where you think , all talk together , you yourself is something lost in the corner and has n't want to <unk> .
this sudden <unk> loneliness to know the safe here all .
may have some they also now been seen .
what you about what you do that cell phone in something very often , that could you today , you see this is doing that <unk> the phone , an escape the <unk> .
the visible , if you on the display , look .
what we now this is n't do .
yes , and then there 's the one , the types of them is the one of <unk> on <unk> stage , hundreds of <unk> faces have a huge and you even something out in the hope that you to their text , not forget .
these are the <unk> that you , though it .
that we other people on .
but i 'm sure , there 's also people in the room , the project from birth of lonely , feeling of all their lives for so he spent , by showing you have tried to this one of the <unk> to distract yourself .
and there 's in this room i also people the lonely , because they 're on a different people up to be it because of death or because of a separation .
there 's using it 's nothing that still so many people , people , where they 're connected to move around them are you feel the lonely .
and there 's people , the relevant to , lost , no contact with more to , and are so lonely .
i <unk> ' that the digital loneliness .
and sit down , you look at the analog loneliness .
the analog loneliness is we 're familiar .
that are people who after their opinion , there 's no , social contact .
it 's always be relatively .
there 's not an official number , not an arbitrary number , whenever somebody coming to human contact , when i do n't .
we cut down there , the old people .
it 's the analog form of loneliness .
since we but everybody in cities in fact , it 's how many people , or facebook , twitter or facebook is this digital loneliness bigger and become .
you can do with hundreds of people to be anything , with one of people really connected to be .
it 's in the analog loneliness to the quantity of human relationships , the missing is it in the digital loneliness the quality of relationships .
the two forms of loneliness to be very often over <unk> .
that 's also that the analog one of a little grew <unk> .
whereas the digital loneliness to really good place for <unk> and columns in <unk> .
it 's this point that the digital loneliness to the future , they gain is when the possibilities , connect to be bigger .
i do n't know , if you in 20 years that feeling that the our from loneliness is very similar to be going , and loneliness to call it .
or whether you for and then a new word that there .
but that are also kind of the problems of the successional generation .
almost more than the one of itself is the fear of the loneliness and from this fear of the one are people can say to do n't ready .
<unk> , the big <unk> , as a <unk> person has a wonderful <unk> written <unk> .
in the way of them , what people do everything to do n't alone .
they build cathedrals , they have kids , then again , lonely , and alone .
but that <unk> has n't you went on the fear of the loneliness to kick out , which is to spend money .
shop , go .
that 's .
both the process over , the one , because it at least a short run a contact in such as the objects themselves , you are acquired by .
only problem is that 's very close to help and holding , this kind of those potions for the one .
so we need to , new things to buy us to <unk> .
i ' time the ads for a a <unk> panties label seen .
and the <unk> , very , <unk> of your communications , if you be doing all of it .
what that in my panties , to do , you know you do n't , but apparently you can also that .
one has so nothing with the <unk> to do one finds the people that instead .

hand on a 's heart , who knows that 's not ?
in a relationship to wake up or the or the other places in <unk> to see , suddenly thing is how to feel , terrible lonely , to feel and the question to ask , who is this man 's really ?
i ' i have , even something to do ?
a study published saying that the <unk> women across the world , married , with kids , feel .
of these are , because i 'd already , you know , if i the study , even invented have so often have , i they told .
but it 's also now , whatever it at least in studies , mostly care is , and the reaction , right is that people , i <unk> .
that intuitive , so completely obvious thing is , almost never been a <unk> .

talk , that little bit about the one the sex .
this is also has probably already has experienced .
so , while you <unk> is , suddenly , to think , what do , i think is really ?
who is this person in my bed , really ?
this is also a form of loneliness that 's not what to have to with the quality of sexual are about .
and nothing to do have to with the quality of relationship .
it 's just always there .
we speak only do n't about them , because we do n't you look .
we speak only , not about them in the workforce .
in the workforce is the one , <unk> when we think .
i stood <unk> on this <unk> <unk> and i 've been watching a group of five <unk> , better , three on death suit and two carried costume either .
the two men have to talk , the two women in a costume designers have the conversation .
and in between was something <unk> , something <unk> with the <unk> in my hand of an intern .
i think , i have to you the scene n't look out on so you that form of loneliness that everybody 's also been times in the fabric has experienced , again <unk> can .
it 's the one of <unk> .
but it 's also the one of <unk> .
we all know the <unk> or i see , in this may also some of their lives , something , <unk> .
in <unk> , in <unk> in the hotels , in the luxury bars that often , and , you know , who they 're actually , what they do .
where they are , where you wake up .
it 's a form of loneliness to the not talking to .
just heard it also <unk> , and loneliness than <unk> misuse it can be .
down here is insulation .
i have a <unk> told that he 'd been one of the clients , and the has said , it 's what it up now , you can do it you did n't imagine .
a <unk> was alone in the lunchroom .
so , he even for <unk> guy .
and two months later , he 's also on .
the one of it 's never been alone so .
she 's not always in touch with other feelings .
she has a sibling and it 's ugly , sibling .
the ugly siblings , we know all .
fear , of your desperation , anger and the shame .
but we should also the beautiful 's not forget .
the freedom of the proud of the desire that <unk> .
so my plea for you look at the one of .
come and goes in life as the tide , and floods occur .
let them , and let them , not from her up .
because there 's still something much worse than the loneliness and this is the emptiness that may , sort of loneliness is if you do n't no longer feel .
and loneliness is part of life .
since i so hard about one thought i have , for me two things .
, in my circle the <unk> i 'm not even more like a disagreement dictator since i realized i did that i only then always somebody who 'd have why he , not raise because i thought i may be recording i the people , you might wind ' i lonely .
i think about it 's been able , since i the one in my life 've got people come and go to them .
so just about the <unk> that you that power .
and there i can become .
people come and go to actually , you , right , who , whether , from an encounter a friendship , or even a partnership you could .
as a child i found my parents , embarrassing .
that can look at any <unk> by , without working with somebody a conversation with anybody .
if the <unk> or in the economy .
every time led it to an average .
as a child i found that as i embarrassed .
as young adult , i know that it for <unk> the way to get this openness to have .
but first since i even so with the one has got to make it me at least , and again , i was also <unk> like to open .
you see it 's very lonely , i mean , willing to do for the next to play .
thank you .
yes , thank you .
i , here , i seem that .
a <unk> a <unk> and a <unk> .
and now , like , i mean , if you just once into one of which is willing , they would take ?
most of you , for the <unk> decide .
and that 's a damn good idea .
and why ?
because we do with the least of effort on the effect in pursuit .
in health , we doing this kind of different .
because we let the activity with the biggest impact , except for eight and make us for other strategy .
we make us for example , <unk> and the is for sports .
big <unk> but big effort .
for me why not so valuable .
or we make us for the <unk> .
the is for diet .
also very large <unk> but still very big effort .
for me so , not so valuable .
and i want you today about how they do with the least of effort into the biggest <unk> achieve .
if you and prevention and health , too , you going to a subject does n't figure around .
and the issue is overweight .
and the theme of obesity , was in germany , long time , no issue , so about to the <unk> .
and then joined the number of obese , in germany and strong .
and i asked me , what was there on in the <unk> ?
why did n't that soar a sudden , up ?
and then i research and i 'm also <unk> become .
because it 's exactly the years <unk> .
what was there ?
there was <unk> , germany .
and we 're going over and along ?
and i keep on .
<unk> comes for , germany .
and that obesity , up .
and the years <unk> take the rate , right at the journey on .
and what 's coming then , germany ?
<unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> , and how does this means .
and we 're going over and along ?
well , i was one , and one , cleared out .
because it was , right .
sports , thick .
and of course , stuck , i now not here , to say that you got this power .
because that 's not true .
but one thing we 've now let 's all of have .
the flood of the new and training -- and <unk> has n't notice that led to be thinner and you’re going .
what it 's so then ?
the diet ?
and there 's the ai n't very good study of the united states .
also the have the problem with obesity .
and they have in the <unk> <unk> introduced .
and then they wanted to mean , look , so what happens is really ?
and they 've seen that people take in fact , less fat on , but the people , and fewer calories to be but nevertheless , and along .
and this was a paradox .
and so you have it <unk> called .
we can this for us ?
there must do the body as a power to imagine .
because we have here it ai , <unk> .
and the one side of it 's a <unk> , i do we all the <unk> on top experts to be here is burned .
and this is the energy <unk> when electricity .
if we now , but more <unk> here in to give in our power than we need to the other side of <unk> the energy in power and it took off .
the human body does n't just get off .
the can the energy to store .
and that in terms of fat .
our greatest and <unk> <unk> .
what happens , but if we are fewer such as we 've heard , energy <unk> and yet <unk> , here the energy and then it 's just a conclusion to .
the <unk> , to drastically reduced .
there , no life , more than it .
we 're yes , only still up .
and this is this happens .
our grandparents are <unk> , 20 kilometers to a fluke .
and we come today i 've been on once on a to two miles and these are the positive estimates .
there 's trials , the report of five -- until <unk> feet .
i <unk> , you that , <unk> with my friend mike , telling .
give you my degrees ' the chair ?
mike , you come degrees ' time ?
mike 's an american .
it 's too shy , he 's not much to talk .
and he was in this study , and sitting now .
he 's this typical <unk> <unk> to me to <unk> <unk> and he has a <unk> in my hand .
and mike eat less and and less and and takes only still <unk> , and yet it 's over and along .
why ?
because it 's mike 's still sitting .
and i was time i watched , how much more movement , mike , so the day , and i was to times as a step counter the back in the bag will put them and the evening , i was again <unk> .
and there stood on a thousand steps .
that was so the distance that mike at has the morning , the kitchen to the car with the car in the office there , a coffee out and night coming back .
and he came on a thousand steps .
that means that mike , at that day , 10 minutes on his legs .
<unk> hours and fifty minutes , i was mike , or whatever was mike .
under those conditions of disease of alone .
and mike 's not so , dick , because it to be much eating , because so long it up again and energy <unk> this , but not used , he will inevitably , and along and the energy <unk> .
and the first <unk> the energy , you see here at his <unk> .
but energy is <unk> that is not there .
the <unk> , eventually got back in <unk> blood .
and there is they 're actively and <unk> still , and quiet in his <unk> .
so the blood sugar .
so if the energy <unk> the blood , you 're talking about the doctors of high blood and high <unk> .
and this blood sugar , the <unk> there 's like <unk> , it 's all this little black holes in this <unk> .
and a lucky , floating in there , the fat around and that up , well over these little wounds and we speak of <unk> or <unk> .
and now comes <unk> heart right under pressure , because now it needs to the blood flows through these tight <unk> pots pumps and we talk from high .
and if this high , then on this is a <unk> true , it 's also in the body off .
and if that the heart , then we call the heart attack .
and if that in mind has happened then we call the stroke .
and also in germany , and dies every second , heart and the stroke .
i mean , in germany , and dies every second , <unk> .
and mike 's so not so sick , because he does n't like sports is driving , but because it , does n't even more moved .
and if you that do n't know , for you always , in the wrong .
for the subject of diet .
i have degrees ' `` yesterday , diet in the amazon , it into and get there environment , <unk> <unk> <unk> , now .
and if each book that 's a centimeter on this is , and we were the here <unk> , we have a 30 feet high tower , the current <unk> <unk> .
and i was the time for you read all .
and there 's inside and now that 's really important if you more energy in so more food as they consume and then you will be thick .
and if you less energy in when they consume and then you will be thin .
that 's brilliant .
but why we need to the environment , books ?
this is one thing to .
the need is huge , but <unk> is to do n't help .
because it fails of diet , a hundred percent ?
because it 's a diet is , and not a lifestyle .
what do the things that we here , three weeks , and here 's five weeks , if we then , after this struggle , again in the normal life back , and to our normal life .
what we then , after five or seven weeks ago ?
nothing .
except <unk> and again a <unk> in the confidence that again , we 're not that we 've done , what we took in .
so to do they go from here today , everyone becomes a diet , in any new <unk> questions , and you want that in their day-to-day , in your lifestyle , into .
yes or no ?
and if yes , then go .
and if no , let 's just stay .
because if the end n't come out , it is that time .
it are the habits of this , they decide whether we 're sick , or a healthy .
it are the bad habits , sick .
and it are the good behavior of us healthy .
and if mike , in the mirror at then he look where the result of everyday lifestyle .
if mike , in the mirror at , then he look there , everyday habits .
and if mike , in the mirror at , and to , is , you see it 's , where it is on .
because when he 's more bad habits , as good , then it 's just the disease , the way .

then he need to just more good behavior as bad .
and a <unk> habits , mike 's also a great example of that the person has been an issue on the animal is .
mike 's for example , did , movement is completely from his life <unk> by it every way to the car to drive every an advantage , every lift the use .
and night and he <unk> the couch and to somehow <unk> , movement .
so , he , in his <unk> going to the gym where with the an after the top is yes , se , it 's and will then how it ai rat , again , like a band <unk> , so he somehow , moving from .
and my grandpa did that the way that any as you .
the was a farmer and the have that 's not understand .
the have said , sport is for people to the n't move .
and somehow he 's also , right .
why we need to night in our most precious and play , that it provides what we the ground in shock of ?
being taken , we have today with this <unk> lifestyle , two hours of sports and make a day .
and about , but very much easier to the back there to find where we do you lose .
the ground .
and so <unk> ' i do you today to a perspective invite you .
may also know , the situation , you drive the evening , quickly to shop , and following , in the front row — no way for free is .
and that you see how are programmed into this <unk> in us is .
we 're always the shortest because they go .
we plan our homes and so that we the <unk> have a way .
we plan our whole life that we the <unk> have a way , but that brings us , but not going , where we <unk> .
but in a very different direction .
so we can you go to the <unk> activate and the back there are finding , where they 've been up .
i check , like to the orbit .
and i 'm the only , always end up and down and up and down on and everybody else to stand .
but if i mean , already , because i 'm then <unk> ' i mean , the time for me .
then <unk> ' i mean , the movement , and just like this room .
and if the top of <unk> , 30 minutes <unk> , say , i <unk> .
environment , steps .
that are about three times 10 minutes , the translation .
and a <unk> environment , steps , if you go from here today , every day environment , steps more , then , that means that she 's the day , twelve gram of fat , not in your body record .
this may be relatively little sound .
but when <unk> , as a habit of saying , let <unk> days , then we talk from four point five pounds of fat .
that we 're not in our bodies .
and you give me degrees ' time that , i <unk> , it always <unk> .
the americans are just nuts , imagine that here .
this is a <unk> of five pounds of fat .
they think , i four pounds .
just so you time you see , what happened there with these little baby steps .
and if that the effect is coming from this perspective , what you mean , what happened just happened , if you really in an active life on .
and these <unk> the get to you . ab now , every day in their day-to-day .
once you in <unk> steps per day , which are going to walk you virtually everybody 's prevalent it .
and if you feel like , and have time in sports and then they do that on top .
then you have to the <unk> also , <unk> .
then you will also , faster and more .
but do with you your health , depending of sports .
so they make your health , depending of like it , and of their time .
because the critical , the that they doing now , every day as much .
and i <unk> , an active life <unk> .
and for me is it has gotten more than a lifestyle , for me , it 's a <unk> that on a clear that decision based for the lives and for me .
because i think , health has not to do with , what we should do , or do have .
but health has to do with , what we want to do .
and so <unk> ' i now only still an idea for them .
and they have the ab now just , for the best .
and ab now you can also how can .
step for step .
thank you .
<unk> how it has a leonardo , da vinci , actually done on this incredible , you see , way of the world with others have to see ?
and yet , so far on that engage in what to his time just simply inconceivable , unless it ?
we could have that also now ?
that might do with companies to do ?
and how do we put this force and confidence for our future to draw ?
we start , but the time , with the question what do we actually sort of innovation ?
it .
this invention of research and development , even the official <unk> the federal government has the <unk> the federal government .
so you know about me , right .
this is yes , all great .
and we can with quite proud to be and be grateful that we <unk> in fact that you fields are that our technologies around the world to be that 's good to go .
that we do with a so extraordinary , unique prosperity that have .
but look like the future of ?
the challenges , because when society based on us to ?
and who cares , because the large environmental and social challenges ?
so <unk> , it seemed kind of fine .
a kind of labor .
so the same thing , the environmental challenges , because the entrepreneurs and then the big effort with the we then productivity and efficiency up .
and the the world better do want to find the nonprofit organization and bring together and citizens and they have to actually , what companies , so if you 're entrepreneurs of course , then the damage the term capitalist in the economy to remove themselves .
at least , very complex to fix .
but who says , because that we also , when that are separated at to ?
what about it because if we <unk> the ai social and cultural dimension , you ?
if technological innovation , as cultural innovation are ?
if of innovations together , as social innovation are ?
if it 's ever leaders , thinking and doing to self-assemble with the solution of environmental and social engineering challenges ?
if it very different kind of unknowns , these <unk> and if it 's even a very different , and fair <unk> to promote ?
because as i was that ?
both sides to have , but what companies , right ?
can we do it ?
ask , you may come .
now , we yes , as a deal with the way .
fortunately , there 's encouraging examples .
muhammad yunus , with his <unk> , with his <unk> in bangladesh is incredibly much does the poverty , there <unk> .
and interestingly , too much more now in direct <unk> of what the government <unk> done .
and he has <unk> as entrepreneurs , i was for the nobel <unk> get .
in the opportunity because of me , i <unk> , they still with anyone familiar to do .
from now , can i think <unk> <unk> .
'n very subtle of young guy .
it 's trained , , but also , they allow it .
and yes , so totally <unk> .
i love the , like .
and if you can to see , then you think , oh boy , our offspring , because we need to us to our future , not going to do .
yes , right after the school , then it 's somewhere here 's begun to work in our <unk> <unk> <unk> .
that he doing well , .
that they like him , and there 's also very successful .
and yet , and so there 's still so in him .
so he asks , there 's not be more , that somehow , i would be there ?
so that the entrepreneurial , he says , then always .
companies are , in all <unk> .
and that they like him too .
and he had fallen as these <unk> .
so the right there 's also the <unk> , it is just get detected .
so not that he told him for you know , but that the <unk> tell him the , what .
and there was in the middle class in the t , three n , i knew he did n't .
so , you cut more he was surprised when the and then the <unk> personally was introduced .
when mister <unk> .
and as 'n an entrepreneur , he then there is that imagined .
the janitor 's great pleasure face , so with young people together , there , his experience of science .
and the two , then you know each other .
and have , more met .
what about it because if we 're looking at times as in a bunch of those conversations from the two times <unk> ?
yes , mister <unk> , so how , because again , right .
what 's right now the difference between <unk> between <unk> <unk> and <unk> a company ?
that i still not so , understood .
yes , so , <unk> then we start , but the time , in the question what 's 'n <unk> company ?
so the name says , yeah .
were markets , established products , established customers , established structures , there 's a history .
and you can also fairly obvious exactly the quest . ab : there , where the big one is causing .
and time , ai ai <unk> , the very neat is it 's also .
what 's because then actually a <unk> ?
so , <unk> , you <unk> been so one of it 's a guaranteed to do n't it is not the small copy of a company .
it 's something very different .
it has just a radically different character .
because it , nothing <unk> .
not by customer , no <unk> <unk> , nothing is known .
of that 's a <unk> a an organization that the purpose is a business to go to find , to the impact of this is , of course , but , <unk> is , then they scale it .
and you certainly understand that it , so <unk> organization , very different very different kind of thinking there , very different <unk> , very different ways .
yes , that 's me , right .
but after what we look for because it ?
so , i <unk> ' time , then let 's , because you can <unk> <unk> to make money right ?
so i , there , degrees , that fits very well , so 'n seminar i found in berlin , would you me that would recommend it ?
that means <unk> .
how you your companies to succeed <unk> and after the <unk> your life for <unk> talk about it .
oh no .
really <unk> ?
what you think , because if you with the beginning , 30 your <unk> money to talk about what 's because we keep your <unk> ?
so we start you just a career as passive <unk> or what ?
what if you with your commitment , i know you ?
and we look , but the <unk> .
so the statistics about <unk> give you do n't <unk> perspective , because seventy percent of <unk> are very few years , then in a much worse , financial situation when i 'm in your great .
money is always the outcome of a successful company , and a good and it a company .
it , money is an energy source of enterprise actions .
and it is the all economic <unk> .
but it 's never the goal of companies .
yes , which is then the goal ?
the company ?
so , i guess what they do , i , but i learned , so without the goal is no way the right .
and so , we really have yet , and this is measurable in time may be and so forth .
and when i think that it 's not have , so that as i can for something of the i do n't know what i 'm supposed to ?
so that i do n't feel good .
so how do i , because we decide , and risks , because that feels , for me all so i think , and inherently .
yes , <unk> welcome the enterprise .
but i , there might do for you .
a thread .
so the is yes , <unk> , so almost never been deeply .
and on the <unk> of generation to generation <unk> .
a <unk> for <unk> .
so , or how to tell you today ?
<unk> think , i , <unk> ?
so we say , always <unk> this .
in for crisis , and <unk> and <unk> more of uncertainty .
so it is guaranteed .
i think , i can you one of contexts .
okay .
yes , thanks , mister <unk> .
but there are , just ask you put them .
that can you the same time i remember one of the enterprise qualities , is good question is to .
we in the time one after the other to go to the perhaps better understand ?
so the first is what i am here and what i want this happen ?
yes , <unk> , there 's <unk> what moves you that about you move beyond that 's bigger than you yourself ?
what <unk> you the world ?
what have the people of them , if you with you work ?
what you are willing to do ?
what are your inner , perhaps , yes , unconscious <unk> ?
why is that important that to see ?
because that are also your business enterprise <unk> .
and how we do this , learn ?
if you a ship to build you want to then <unk> not the men together bits of work a hot , wood to collect , but i teach them , yearning for the sprawl , an ocean .
yeah , .
so then i look , i let me the next questions .
what 's my <unk> <unk> ?
what is that ?
yes , <unk> now you can do your goal really time i could .
actually could in detail , colorful , but i <unk> , you 'll have a if you <unk> , what you do n't want to then it will , you 're staying .
you know , the story with the pink and elephants ?
now , there is a .
not ?
<unk> .
so , along time on .
reset it tells you let 's not a pink and elephants .
okay ?
it does it 's been ?
so , not a pink and elephants .
understand ?
no pink and elephants .
you see ?
so let 's us , if we were so on to focus on this , what we do n't want .
what is there 's actually the only way ?
because it <unk> ?
yes , right , get out , you that of what you want .
so <unk> <unk> or maybe the baby pandas and <unk> .
but you get a 's not to visualize ago .
the way , what i just let me , you like , <unk> right ?
i , you , there , with them .
look over time , if you <unk> .
<unk> <unk> in this war room <unk> lord smith .
and who ?
at <unk> of three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i of what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady , smith .
oh , but you ♫ but <unk> <unk> you <unk> ?

<unk> from <unk> .
it 's just a <unk> of <unk> .
the real <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk> you ?
and <unk> what 's from ?
you what i noticed ?
, something changed ?
okay .
okay , and the flower , too .
okay .
so , and then we can look , but the time , then , let 's where the bear with that 's .
and action .
<unk> <unk> in this war room <unk> lord smith .
and who ?
at <unk> of three <unk> this <unk> what <unk> <unk> to death with a <unk> <unk> .
i <unk> <unk> of you to <unk> me your <unk> at <unk> the time <unk> <unk> <unk> place .
i <unk> the glass in the master <unk> .
i of what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sir .
and i of what <unk> my <unk> in the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> 24-year-old lady , smith .
and <unk> , let 's not to this ?
so , i know , i was also be shocked .
i was really shocked .
when i the first saw was .
i thought it ca : yes , it was being .
and still much more shocking , i was as me through the head into this is it might be that i actually the sort of this way through the area over ?
by my life .
and okay , i understand , this is yes , meaning .
to wake up there , the immediate <unk> to prevent that we the most of our perception and our <unk> first <unk> to .
but what 's because now , to ?
what <unk> ' i was and what <unk> ' i 'm from ?
and so <unk> , among you your perception and specifically , somewhere <unk> to , it ai n't even more important entrepreneurial quality .
well , thanks , then we get it this time to the next question .
how i could actually to my goal to come ?
so , i find that ai n't good question .
that 's like , i which every time , and i know that somehow not going forward .
yes , <unk> , there 's it ai n't good news for you .
that you get lighter and fall when you may have known about it .
because if you your what 's clear , your inner drive and if you 'n in fact is very rough presented so what did i promise you , is it inside of happen by .
almost automatically .
you will not unlike you can than that a brainstorming , you 're going to make things on you are kind .
that are then this famous <unk> that you in the shower , your .
and , ai n't question i recommend you , to look , you a good to , who you have them could who you to take an interesting questions could talk to there more input , more at with home to get .
and you 've also a model .
the <unk> have the great want .

to lunch at the famous big table .
and that 's totally different people .
so scientists , <unk> , politicians , a banker , as engineers , architects and it ai n't very intense <unk> clean .
but not in our modern day senses , where it to figure went , who 's the ?
who 's right ?
but rather than to that of these different <unk> things that are the so on no way of one of himself had to come to .
well , the next question is what is the next step i do ?
<unk> there are doing it 's successful entrepreneur in the reason .
instead of to develop and management and so what you , just in the next step .
because what you , because in terms of uncertainty , do ?
but the lead this really determined and with all the consequence of .
and if it 's and then there was well , dan is supposed to you , <unk> different step .
and even if the big , colorful <unk> <unk> nothing was then there 's , ai other .
it 's why it 's so important that you 're saying what 's clear .
that gives you the inside of security .
and the way , how we actually have all going to learn ?
although we that yes , do n't know , and it , nobody has said ?
-- and says , also <unk> in children .
so , this playful and learn that is a search and this <unk> playful and it 's also , the fun doing that in a company is happening in a <unk> .
and that 's also just sort of the <unk> against the uncertainty , otherwise , so anxious .
yes , thanks ! mister <unk> .
so that sounds , yes , very good at .
but i do n't know , with me in the company , i think , there must , a lot of bosses change that there anything happens .
and the reasons , here in germany , there 's always like this gives the mood .
and i think , there have to the politicians to find out to worry that the changes .
okay my boy , come from the time with .
how do this time , down to the water .
what you think , many people can you change ?
10 ?
thousand ?
ten million ?
look at this down .
if you see ?
alright , the .
this is the you change can , you really change can .
or about it , mahatma gandhi to say , for the change that you in the world , looking in you yourself .
you think , beautiful words and huge role models , but how do that because it work ?
because we have to happiness , 'n few <unk> on our <unk> .
helpful in all <unk> of crises , or if you to small , you feel for something or if you a <unk> squad and you 've all with you to do .
and if you fall in of these situations , wondering what you see you now despite all this to ask , you , which is you take you can physically , you very powerful to feel .
it 's like , you , but the time , what you to them like , to make you 're <unk> .
and , finally , to ask , you , what you actually sort of this crisis , or the , what happened is because what did .
so i mean , if , you already happening is going to give it at least worth it has .
yeah well .
mister <unk> thank you .
and you think that you want to me that helps on my enterprise way ?
yes , right .
and among you do so , two things .
first time the expression on the clarity of your inner <unk> , then to your hugely to do what will .
because that determines your perception .
and to the second one on your inner attitude to myself to .
because it <unk> you like the other people , to you behave .
the future of the only then when we our own change perceptions .
<unk> you that to ?
yes , i think , already .
thanks ! mister <unk> well then .
all good <unk> <unk> .
yes .
what you think of our <unk> ?
nice .
now , or , <unk> ?
and how we hold , because now , with this <unk> ?
it 's a new <unk> ?
i mean , yeah .
clear .
which i do so , the spirit , i see .
<unk> is to breathe tapped .
and that is , what the <unk> really is like .
a <unk> from potions for the euphoria .
and no , so new <unk> , <unk> .
now there 's the <unk> .
the right now this country has been in the big , the name <unk> .
from robert bosch , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> or how they all the hot .
let us , just that spirit to animate them .
and who knows that might be yes , from our <unk> the leonardo in our time .
you see , i 'm <unk> .
maybe it would be so intuitive to me with kids and their future i 'm concerned , because finally , yes , so to our future .
instead is that the way , i of the time i enjoy .
i spend a lot of my life in prison .
four years ago , my father and i was the program <unk> , entrepreneurship , for prisoners , created .
we could qualify <unk> captures that means you can , after the prison , either on making or find after their i was lighter one of the workplace , they actually , can hold .
why <unk> i so now , so happened to <unk> , so the ones who have failed are the big mistake i 've done ?
our program is a much not as easy to understand how programs that the kids do .
and frankly , had said , i thought that the <unk> the last place in the universe is , i work would .
what you think that 's the most of a factor in childhood , with the people with that we work ?
we 've learned , it are positive models often the male , positive models .
and if you think about , why it in certain <unk> so many <unk> and so many <unk> there are often is it that the father 's no sensible work , that it , '' -- that he drugs which is , or that it yourself in prison is .
and if you a seven-year-old child think about what it from his life to make it may not even better idea , as a different lives might look , because he had no better models .
and he <unk> his father .
i <unk> , you , martin , imagine .
martin 's <unk> our program .
his father was an alcoholic and the whole family that live in the hell .
when he was 12 , is his mother died , and he and be a little baby brother who had to the home .
there was he the <unk> the great .
he was shy and <unk> and the perfect victims .
to the day as being a little baby brother , in a game , so roughly <unk> that was that the bottom are stuck .
there was burned in at the first time the <unk> through , he went on the enemy , and proposed to .
and go from this day he was respect .
and it went off .
violence was part of well , his life that 's the his father .
how it 's now at the ones that i just described . i , next ?
after the childhood , the youth who are lots of unemployed or have <unk> .
you 're not much different than your illegal activities and their <unk> <unk> .
and then you will be one day with people in jail is closed organizations that 's like that goes , their thoughts about the same thing around the , no better models are .
about what , you think , think these people together , when you put together in prison are ?
mostly about not much good .
and they 're going to criminal justice in <unk> .
they sell and these drugs on a higher level , and we 're still in the prison where you after the prison <unk> could .
and that then in germany to <unk> of <unk> percent .
i mean , in germany will everyone on the second criminals to prison .
then there 's but also people in prison , the project really change , you .
but also , these people wear a rubber from the forehead .
and there 's <unk> .
and everywhere , where they come , is that your first identity .
if you know , a work for , if you know , an apartment for whether they new private relationships that we want you 're going to them with this identity , with that rubber face , you one who in the society that infinite hard power .
this is the problem , the we are .
how we try that problem to solve ?
what property , you think , and many <unk> with ?
they would be surprised .
it , entrepreneurial skills .
who have a <unk> built it 's definitely no idea of <unk> , of <unk> and of <unk> .
the only the subject <unk> it 's a little <unk> , otherwise something , he 's not in prison , did .
these characteristics we want to a good use .

we all of the basics of entrepreneurship and the economy .
everybody in order to write its own <unk> and everybody could take on a comprehensive <unk> part .
and then with we the people , after the prison in the <unk> , <unk> in that strengthening of your personal relations and also in one of <unk> .
what for a big , because of our program from ?
it 's a range , from <unk> the agency for <unk> .
we have a <unk> and <unk> .
a range and to <unk> ' i 'd like betti imagine .
<unk> leaders , talent and his illusion , is money , it 's been very early to trade with their seduced .
he had always been fun , businesses to this .
he 's then <unk> the first time arrested .
and those later it was n't very impressed me .
all the point .
he says , i have today , he got at his second later prepared .
<unk> is he then to the second time , convicted .
and he then only a wall of therapy , and then the <unk> .
and there was he 'd like he would be the leaders , talent for something <unk> can use .
he 's in september 13 had been , then october <unk> its energy agency for <unk> started .
the agency 's well , he can now of life .
he , very good <unk> the design .
he 's now here with me .
who him to know each other to talk about it .
, back to martin , that i told him at the story about how did .
martin , after his childhood a training to really just leave and ended up in his time in the <unk> <unk> .
and alcohol , and drugs , there on the agenda are was being that is very quickly started .
he was working with a dj , and as <unk> .
twenty years , which he this life .
and he says , today , that he did with this lifestyle to do n't own consciousness <unk> .
one day that he does anyone in a <unk> so hard that he then he convicted by the world .
he took the <unk> part and that <unk> there 's really his life changed .
he learned , he to more force to more success and to more life could come without his <unk> to make juice or without drugs to consume .
and he was of your knowledge , so excited that he had decided that i want it would pass .
and he wanted part of the <unk> be .
it 's unclear ] .
he works for now , two years in us and <unk> our main collaborator on their way into the freedom , because he knows , ourselves that , if you , really change want , and if you have the right tools with the hand , you do that much more possible is when you often when i want .
the basis of these successes are the way people as you .
people to us in jail get the to external up with us to come to our participants in their <unk> , in your personal plans to get you .
that are our authority , the <unk> talks in our class , it 's see , students at the <unk> do , <unk> the begin to do .
and that are we 've met , our participants , right after the prison with .
and these people take a lot of our program with .
one example .
we do on up an exercise , the <unk> called .
we stick and then in the space a big so on our participants are the , and our an stand on the other side .
and i then , different question .
and every time , if anyone in space that question , yes , you answer to kick it at the line .
and here shows , what we all together , whether we within the prison are , or outside .
but also , where the differences are .
and for example of this , where the differences are , is this question .
i 'm going to a call social focal up , i had a family member of what , once in custody .
there are usually a lot of our participants in front of the line and very few of our an environment .
a question , and i 'm going to us all together , the <unk> ' i 'd like you imagine .
that i urge you that they all even get up .
maybe we had a little light get in the audience .
i can you see .
there 's all .
well .
thank you .
i get out , you now a question , and if you that question , yes , you 're trying to put them , again , otherwise would remain they just stand .
that 's sort of our our line that we 're going to move .
i have in my life of things done , for the i was punished , can be , it 's not .
if you that question , yes , you 're trying to put them , please .
that counts , drunk car went to be .
that counts , maybe too low doses of going into an have them .
that counts , the seat , not , and in to have .
okay .
and it 's also to be any workforce , not always very correctly for have them .
all right .
most of the seats .
we have a few angel in space .
that 's wonderful , because i 'm happy .
thank you , they must , all back down .
in this question , if we the events , imagine , get our an environment very often to me .
and you will also clear , how much broader happiness , you may have had .
happiness with the parents , happiness with the environment , in the they were growing up , with the friends , but also very lucky , that you may not always with those caught by , if you something on the <unk> or also about it out to have done .
what are the results of our work ?
sixties percent of our alumni , from within <unk> days after their i was a work .
this is a very quickly .
<unk> percent of the already on the time .
third of donor cycles in the past year we were <unk> .
and our <unk> is at seven percent .
i did it already told the <unk> of seven percent is a <unk> in germany , <unk> percent of us to .
i 'm <unk> .
a <unk> costs in <unk> per year , taxpayers <unk> euros .
and it 's a <unk> , -- what a <unk> of seven percent of us to a <unk> of typically <unk> percent for a saving means .
when my father and i do that <unk> founded , they are we open , putting away from pretty much for quite nuts , that i 'd been .
i was my great <unk> in a big businesses , given up .
but i must tell you , i in my life , not as a <unk> work done .
we encourage our participants that 's responsibility to take .
responsibility , in your life 's happened , and so , responsibility for to wrestle , in their lives will happen .
and not to hide , nothing to <unk> .
because that leads to a very new consumer confidence and what it 's also , again , trust to build .
and so it makes me , especially happy and pride , when our participants , of their way to tell us .
now i you a video with them .
film .
so i was convicted to two years , and eight months , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was because <unk> against the <unk> to three years , and 10 months convicted .
i do with you 're going into it .
so , i judgment of two years , because of a dangerous <unk> .
i was convicted of <unk> and <unk> <unk> with <unk> .
so , through my participation in <unk> , actually my whole life changed .
and what for me was important , was this <unk> , too .
because there was my , my absolute <unk> .
i was n't <unk> , '' ' i almost to say , yeah .
i went back goals of eyes tip .
i 've got back into perspective of mine , again , the drawing on .
and you go with a very different awareness and consciousness from the prison out .
so far 's it more and <unk> without any kind of goals and then is you , in and so <unk> .
with the wrong people together and this now , you .
well , the problem is that many no assistance , if that emerge .
that the biggest problem , because then it 's automatically which is that you back in the old , faculty will come .
you know , nothing else .
by this <unk> individual <unk> , whatever , because it was offered is , with me just my whole mindset of me to yourself , about other , over the a new problems , the user 's interacting with the society , that , with me just during these two weeks , completely around .
i 've been <unk> of my first woman : divorce .
and has been happening internationally , six months . bye '' i went back with her together .
so that means , we have a new relationship started .
and because i sit under one , through this whole <unk> and many other things change . i .
so much . i ' i already done .
i 'm with my family back in pure form of education started .
so i work today in my <unk> , '' ' i say .
i go , just a <unk> to <unk> .
you know that actually acknowledge that 's very , many people are the fact , for my mentor , also now , about this time still out and actually about being , i do n't know , <unk> and beyond the people to support .
i 'm grateful for you to the idea at all come are you to so what do .
i 'm grateful for that they do it , with certainty , who he pulled , and i 'm extremely grateful for me to be part of all for .
that are one of course , the people , the support , and they were .
i like i said , with many people in the events which , and the me , confirmed , that 's good , that do .
and that of wind ' i 's also do .
and say , i thank you .
they come with us in jail .
each of you have something that we need to .
if you know , our participants in their <unk> which , if you know when the <unk> to come from us whether they in the frame of a financial support that are .
if you know , our program in a new <unk> you want , <unk> issue .
talk , please .
martin betti and i are here today .
and look for us on the conversation with them .
thank you .
<unk> i 've done in <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> <unk> in nepal <unk> .
in a time , i knew that there was .
because you do yes , these things .
now , for <unk> for .
the <unk> go .
a sabbatical in the monastery .
there 's yes , today , many ways as you with <unk> deal .
specifically as you <unk> deal .
anyway , i was <unk> also a way .
with my work and so 'n bit with the <unk> .
which i think is really of <unk> talk to .
and not from real problems .
my problem was i was <unk> and i could tell me , what could be like my life in 10 or two , 30 years will look .
it was <unk> .
and this predictability and i did scary .
now , it at least , express .
, i had an adult <unk> crisis .
for as private .
i knew just not to the <unk> way to happen ?
do it me just lazy way ?
or what if i mean <unk> back to throw this ?
and look , then what happens .
what then on me wait .
that were so the idea .
i was in this time , free <unk> in a day .
as i <unk> .
the <unk> , to me , despite <unk> the absolute <unk> .
you fluently , free the world 's living in very good hotels and write fluently , the country on a very <unk> way of .
fluently , but occasionally , <unk> countries .
the developing countries where it sure anymore , and say , there as a quaint villages , kind <unk> people for the fact that they have nothing , so about happiness and joy of broadcast .
that kind of these images and to cliché about living , but a <unk> way too .
and that , to me after a while the key .
i was that what i did for a little bit .
to data .
and i found it sort of <unk> of me about a country to write to judge that i really did n't really know .
that i wanted to change .
i wanted to countries , right to know .
the <unk> was invited to write code .
and to my personal passion to be breastfeeding .
how you are better know ?
by showing you with the people who lives .
in the people who lives , you home .
not in the hotel .
by , with the challenges and with the problems of people engaged .
and so as you with the people who works .
at least that was the answer that i went on this question there was .
and that i wanted to do .
and i wanted something worthy .
i wanted a contribution to afford .
something to do good .
and this sense , with me in a <unk> still further from .
i was , they 'd been coming in developing world , nepal , i was just a particularly touched .
until <unk> was there 's a 10 year-old civil war , not just over and orphans , but also lots of economic and social problems and left .
with an annual income of <unk> dollars is nepal 's poorest country in asia .
and it 's going to continue to the two decades , the poorest countries the world .
a quarter of the population lives below the poverty .
almost a fifth of the one of malnutrition .
forty percent of the adult can do n't read and write .
all these facts , it 's how many personal stories and experiences that i on this journey has had met me in a time , i was willing and frankly , to change .
in the i even something , and just wanted .
and drum up after my return of nepal , my decision .
i quit my job .
and she me in the aid .
and i <unk> ' now , just an excerpt from the answer to return that i on my job application received .
because they just a defining who was .
it 's going to a serious application in <unk> international by a company .
and not to a <unk> for a <unk> <unk> the , at the time in nepal 's lives , i want , and a funding , and for .
hi ?
let 's still ?
i was really serious thing and good .
at least i thought that .
and that answer was a <unk> <unk> .
i was really down .
and i did , of course , a very emotional response , writing .
and fortunately , never <unk> .
instead . i ' i do this , right at the sense , to what good <unk> to do .
i it used as an engine , to my own business to reasons .
<unk> .
heart labeled and soul <unk> .
a company that , that offers , what i was preparing for you have .
which is the way of a country unlike to do .
the way of a country right to meet .
and i do with the people , in my life and can work .
and that 's not anywhere can work , but in to <unk> .
<unk> you can actually in the two words , though .
so karma , and <unk> .
that means much , like a place in which you know how karma collect it .
in which you know how can do .
so this is now 'n little bit <unk> .
but it 's not .
<unk> is a social <unk> business .
we use the tourism , as a tool for sustainable development .
specifically what we use <unk> as a tool for sustainable development .
so <unk> , volunteering and unsustainable tourism .
because the people to us to afford , during and meaningful volunteering .
they pay for their journey , just like a different organizers .
but they travel , it works differently .
you live in <unk> .
and the objective is n't care as much the recovery or as much <unk> but the real <unk> exchange .
social engagement .
and we broaden our .
to speak to participants ever , qualification , and interests in various projects .
we can go through our work for a gentle tourism , in the regions of the otherwise , no chance on the classic tourism , have .
because just the inside the infrastructure that 's missing .
for others can we sustainable projects forward .
we can reduce their sustainable projects -- and finance .
we 're so to a hundred percent of itself .
are also not on giving wheelchair-bound .

now we did with our work <unk> in nepal .
<unk> year we our engagement in uganda expanding .
and now after about four years to us now i got married and my husband and i are also for a team of <unk> question .
we take the <unk> way to continue ?
or what if we still more of thinking ?
if we the <unk> still banging on this ?
if we do with this , not just a social engagement and sustainable in my but the development in his wholeness that ?
and so , the individual <unk> have them ?
or , from individual <unk> .
that would then , a new one extra company .
a company , that , company itself .
with other <unk> but the same philosophy , like <unk> .
, we want ?
i was the next question .
'n new business ?
sure , we want .
we love the entrepreneurs and their creative companies .
because we 'll be ticking .
because we the same language .
because we the same dreams , and dreams .
because we the challenges to understand .
and so we have the year in <unk> a nurse , given .
<unk> .
and with <unk> and we 're creative companies in its development and to <unk> that we by an extraordinary people to support .
to be with we the participants who or the staff of creative companies with individual development <unk> .
so <unk> the personal social and <unk> `` the <unk> which do .
and <unk> the <unk> prepare .
the there 's in <unk> , again .
a tour of the next to a meaningful <unk> , one more huge masses .
he shows a in relatively short time , where you is , or where you <unk> .
where you may still unknown and prejudice .
where you may have had a little fact is , to <unk> in thinking .
and he shows a on , what you really good .
that one of its strength of eyes .
it 's the creativity , suddenly , great .
or something that 's the serenity , you can try to in the self .
of serenity and things just assume that you do n't we can change .
and the power , things to change that you can change .
and you can be very much change .
already in very short time .
we know that .
one of this .
that are <unk> rose <unk> , named lydia and <unk> .
that are five , and women from uganda .
and sad non-zero-sumness and with a talent .
they would be a beautiful , deserved <unk> for years .
and for years happened .
because they simply no market for .
because they did n't know , the quality can improve .
because you , nobody has said , which design may be in the question is .
we wanted to these women help .
and therefore , in this year , a <unk> started .
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
we have the people of poverty , get .
that you an income there .
a future to occur .
we 're yesterday with our <unk> live gone .
and we start with a first <unk> edition .
a <unk> edition of thousands <unk> of our women .
the sale to you 're not just for a year , income .
but allows us , the project , more to do .
this first edition , is sort of the social crowd <unk> and <unk> in one .
so who are going to , can this , with the purchase a chain of doing to the other , it , but with us , right into the project to travel .
he can be able to the women who travel and the active <unk> .
the long will we 're not only five women of giving , but fifty or a hundred .
and that 's not just in uganda , but in nepal and in other <unk> , in which we <unk> work .
and this is , but this <unk> just a project from our possibility , cycle of projects .
we 're working in all the central areas .
in <unk> <unk> and health and <unk> and <unk> .
because the work in the only one area , it 's .
what happens with the kids when the women who work ?
right .
so we have in this year in nepal and in uganda , two <unk> centre , started .
everything we 're in our own cycle on each other .
and the power to be more sense , as any one project for yourself .
in place where we 've ever , qualification into the various projects .
the opportunities are , then , just in the joy of work .
and i 'm going to i 'm so now , right on a take away .
and to please , i 'm so the eyes to restore .
reset , you , you 're in africa .
in rural heart of uganda .
you 're sitting on a wooden dining room .
and you are satisfied and tired .
you 're dealing with your <unk> to lunch eaten .
there 's <unk> .
<unk> .
tasty .
the walls are <unk> .
in there is it 's warm .
you <unk> out the window .
and see these kids in the <unk> <unk> <unk> .
their <unk> feet tumble through the sand on .
you <unk> on your <unk> .
also on them is a thin <unk> dust .
the children with laughter .
and calls for having your name .
you <unk> you that they do you , just <unk> call .
<unk> .
you know , not , what time it 's .
but soon as you get up .
and the <unk> , the men 's still the kids were , <unk> .
the end of the street is a tree .
here you going to lydia .
in the meadow , sitting in front of the tree so you the new designs of <unk> talk about .
like , you with my hands and feet to talk .
later come , the other women on this .
they smile , you <unk> .
until you with your english start .
under the tree .
in .
just , that it 's still the internet , there .
this morning <unk> you back with your coach .
that <unk> you .
the exchange is every time value .
and it 's beautiful time again deutsch , to talk .
you 're hearing the music .
and that <unk> of <unk> .
mom <unk> washing in the courtyard , the pots .
they sing an african proverb that song .
you are relaxed , and happy .
you are the eyes , again on doing .
of us can the <unk> to come to what 's something new engage .
now , or for a short time that cube , i 'm going to throw away .
and to look what happens .
thank you .
before i 'm starting to be an interest me , whether of you today at night , they 're here , and have time someone 'n ' house work up .
i just know , with the light , not that really well , but perhaps want to someone came up .
here just know , i hear somebody .
two .
here , up just know , i 'm not , but , down here are already , two , that 's nice , we 're already time to <unk> .
i ' , a building up and that the villa mountain in east , the city <unk> .
this is the building .
and with two decades , the other people have , i the villa out in the last summer , six months for up there .
and so stuck , i now here tonight , you .
well , and , like now some of you might say .
so what 's also ?
<unk> there 's `` yes , many .
but i want it for just .
oh , what you up now the villa along ?
and you <unk> in the park or how ?
one small variety of questions , we know , friends , colleagues have asked when they 've learned that i part of an initiative , i whistle , which , something <unk> name , <unk> 'm .
all those that we transition in the series of <unk> <unk> had .
and here in order to these villa <unk> up did , <unk> world and so in suspended .
and to the privatization of villa out to protesting .
but who i know , you know that 's not my kind of <unk> .
and it was also not the elected <unk> the initiative .
what we see here , is a sign of the <unk> passage in <unk> .
this is a public space , you privately is , and so for many people do n't available to it says , <unk> ' i do n't say , but it 's not in public hand is and will not so used to be about how to public spaces may take advantage .
we were a group of <unk> together in the desire to <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , sensitive and sustainable to deal .
and we wanted to a different <unk> tell .
we were a <unk> team and that i must now very quickly see , because it was a very <unk> team .
from the areas of architecture , planning , social -- , politics -- and <unk> <unk> , statistics , design , music , photography <unk> , <unk> and <unk> .
now , simultaneously , with different social and cultural and personal <unk> .
our perspectives <unk> and enriched the .
and have us to , on different skills , but also on various networks <unk> .
and creative in part unconventional solutions in the <unk> that we then did , <unk> to realize .
we 've actually navigated to the villa out to occupy .
however , about it 's about that we the villa with stories and ideas that people .
we have a different memories and i 'm asking .
and of those memories and images out , trying to be outlook for the villa out to develop .
and it 's important to the process and more constructive remains .
us as an initiative , we have , and i always as <unk> platform and as <unk> terms .
so i was <unk> a <unk> and emotional thing and , and better to a <unk> .
the experiences that we and ted , <unk> ' i today at night do .
every city has <unk> places .
the a neighborhood a face there .
in many were these all the macro level and <unk> and be in the result of citizens of strangers are perceived value .
they are the dead -- a town because it 's often not the equal , what we 're in a public space expect .
so for that we <unk> , <unk> have .
are these , but also the fact , public , the urban places from point , this will often did .
initiatives , the places like would want to stay in many also <unk> interest , in their infancy to do .
what 's also with me to do , like it 's some questions , like some outside of questions .
i mean , a lot .
these places , giving our town , not just a face .
no .
they are the social places of the city , in our social life is happening .
so how we there are often the first <unk> that they to our neighbors , if we wanted to the way to shop .

and we just 'n longer you 'll have .
it to form friendships , sometimes .
but what 's certainly going to that 's a sense of community .
ever more profound encounters , and in this is a public space . i , more and faster and more of it 's also that community .
and when i do n't <unk> , which is just that , what you probably the memory of a big city called .
we were then , two challenges .
we can look at the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for your neighborhood up or in <unk> also <unk> be .
how can protest in the creation be transformed ?
how can only criticism in the ideas to be transformed ?
a protest against the privatization , and <unk> this <unk> <unk> places and criticism , the growing and actually also not much <unk> of the same places .
imagine , you now , they sit here , again , they beat the newspaper , and read the following the text .
i love the zones , and citizens , we invite you , we want you three kinds of different varieties , redesigning the <unk> imagine that have a before carefully <unk> <unk> designed .
they must be in the following the idea of a nuance , pick .
and the variation in the most <unk> is then <unk> implemented .
they would go ?
would anyone from them to this event , go ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it 's just a great .
it there ai to what it .
they ca <unk> the way in the future looks .
and again , it sounds , first time , it in the first moment .
i trial , i still remains of an explanation .
and that , because i the opinion , they ca n't really has or pick up or shape , <unk> .
one , because the classic <unk> a lot to be late <unk> .
that means mostly they do n't have any chance to really , your suggestions , or some alternatives to discuss , but there 's actually , ai design and they ca <unk> still going to decide whether they <unk> or <unk> in the city , green plants .
or , as a friend who recently , what color the trash , for example .
second kind of classic <unk> 's rarely spoke about information and vote out .
you think about the three <unk> varieties .
we have is what that we want to show you , and they must then you can vote .
frustration and incomprehension -- are often , the what i also kind of which is .
i have to any decision about <unk> or <unk> meeting when i really like it ai <unk> route of <unk> <unk> had .
it goes , but also different .
although we can be able to overcoming the existing <unk> lot of conversation in fact , we ultimately , it disturbed about .
so we experience up and the , i for other <unk> share .
i want it on the other initiatives , at the other projects , but also , or so , at the city and at the policy .
because of the ones who are , like <unk> actually able to try and the really responsible for these things are .
if , which is really the interest in what is , how it so often to struggle and let 's then we need and then we need to them new <unk> .
not , <unk> ' i but also , they all that you today , sit here .
and that 's why , because i <unk> for a really think .
i , ' it for important that they all go , and i want them with our example , encourage , the <unk> still a chance to give them .
and i watch me , they all , because they are the ones that in the who did a new <unk> demand .
so , we have to participation look like to the citizens of consciousness , responsibility and engagement for your neighborhood and got to participation and <unk> to be tapped it ?
one is open for the conversation on the field .
in <unk> meet the professionals in a reporter , citizens on <unk> and different parts of interest them .
what we see here is a picnic , to the we invited to have .
what we see here , are some <unk> and <unk> in the conversation with citizens .
the goal to be that all these conversations on the field of people , so that not the <unk> interests , or the <unk> skills about the skills of citizens are .
the citizens , there are experts , they 're experts , for your neighborhood , you know , what you missing , which <unk> you with a place to connect , in which to be a place is , and also , what you a place , lacking .
the <unk> , in the city can put myself , what on <unk> level in the project to do .
in alone or in in a particular case , can then another <unk> be involved in the subjects to make that 's on the project and are the after .
all this leads to a <unk> , all of information for all freely accessible , and the then the place to be .
by maybe , you get to return , an identification of the place to .
a conversation on the field also means that the wishes , the residents in fact taken seriously .
and that 's also then , if somebody says , i want a <unk> the marketplace .
that can course , believing in just be , but the goal to be , in <unk> dialog with all of <unk> , which is the solution and maybe in <unk> , the <unk> all , but perhaps , a different place .
again , it 's got to the conversation turns out then form .
second point are ways <unk> .
our <unk> 's colorful .
one feels , completely comfortable , when he was <unk> large group is , and you can talk .
a different from it 's good writing me , but the text , then , <unk> large group .
a different to what might be happy or photographing it .
or building his ideas in <unk> <unk> on .
what i say it tries to be different <unk> give the different market up to be .
we have here for the way , just to come , there , the first time to watch , what happens .
in the background , ai small exhibition .
we have is the opportunity had , <unk> to give them .
we have the opportunity had to paint .
we have the opportunity had to write .
from the age .
that was a <unk> girl .
we had the way of our ideas with their faces to connect to play with ideas to <unk> .
also the way , outside of <unk> <unk> to participate , should always been able to be .
that can for example of a <unk> happen , it over <unk> <unk> happen .
the basis , and transparent having the results of the dialogue , under the are .
we even have the process out all on facebook with this , and on one of independent blog , news <unk> about a <unk> distributed .
our third point <unk> .
you remember , maybe that i said that <unk> often to be late on today .
in my <unk> event there 's been three finished <unk> .
<unk> is the process , but then when he early , takes place and the them in its best , even still do n't know , with <unk> we need to happen to .
if through the dialogue , and so i 'm going back to the point , one got to be discussed this is what kind of scenarios for an area in the question .
<unk> heard the way , to <unk> itself .
and that then , if not from the beginning of that is that the <unk> event , and so i look , but the experiences from the previous built .
what happens now , if the citizens of your city from and your city <unk> .
it 's already in numerous projects to see .
i , this is an example from <unk> , is the <unk> , is probably in many of this is known .
in new york was just a project launched , there 's about a <unk> .
in <unk> <unk> 're there 's inside of six weeks <unk> dollars to come together the funding to be done should do now , or <unk> .
the time has to in august i wrote the politics , could not unlike , as the idea to their own to do .
also the <unk> in new york , to the i think , i , to say , because he has to one of the <unk> the city 's become was no idea of politics or drug administration .
the point , the <unk> for the <unk> were already .
in <unk> , so we 're back in germany , the citizens , it so plans to very essence of a sense , again <unk> .
the city was told <unk> 's not necessary .
the four weeks <unk> that we for <unk> <unk> , the rich , as <unk> .
today is the <unk> the city , offline .
during the side <unk> d e there it works and the city the <unk> the initiative that , there 's started , and other <unk> supported .
and elsewhere , painting for their own crossing the road .
in rotterdam , there was a <unk> <unk> .
all worked so far , you now say .
then we do but now , just so on .
but i think it for the wrong , the city of the responsibility to them .
why ?
for a , because they just a look for a 's all , or should have .
during the dedicated , whether it citizens of initiatives , or company during the rule on a for them in some form the relevant than in the focus has the city against the responsibility for the projects that 's also the attention to stand .
and to the other of course , the city of the projects that does , are other tool available to .
a <unk> initiative , this only <unk> of .
also our goal was actually a an initiative that after her school , and i was about half a year of the results and the responsibility , the city , who wanted .
-- was a <unk> has the villa in january .
it run , there .
so we have unfortunately , the problem that we the responsibility , not deliver those were .
but we know , now that when the city of a villa successful <unk> when the negotiations can actually succeed , and then a <unk> there is .
in what form of the place is , however , frankly .
and finally , now , i 'm convinced of that many projects that by their meaning , complexity or , cost of the city has evolved to have a chance of happiness than being and positive identification , to create .
if you only time and the conversation with the citizens <unk> be .
in each of the city and citizens .
in each of the city and you all that you today at night in this .
if we put them on and at the policymakers the <unk> the citizens , when you stop as well , but as profitable .
that 's it .
last night , the <unk> we were here in <unk> in <unk> and are so the <unk> come .
we have about <unk> talked about .
so this idea , ai n't second chance to have , if it in this life did n't really , that 's easy , ai n't second chance .
we found very exciting .
and we were , but relatively fast we agree that 's two things there , we do n't , see that we wanted .
this is the puberty .
the second , there was also , by the table , the school ?
no way .
no way .
school , some of you remember , perhaps more humble out <unk> .
at me is it , now , that <unk> years ago , but the word `` do with me , to <unk> hands .

and then i 'm not , how it at them , but in my exams , then , the of the <unk> taken seriously , the sitting in the next to me .
no idea , what 's from the really it 's gone .
they 're going to understand it , so , my school was n't really nice and after i then my final <unk> behind me do was completely clear , never again , school .
and so what i 'm going to say , when i on the year <unk> back of the most days , i there 'd have , i ' i in schools have spent .
with a desire and totally be .
how she was there 's that ?
like this happened ?
that started first time to make that something happens is , what i do n't be able to .
i got kids .
so , my wife 's got the children .
and therefore , then also very clear that you one is that the time that <unk> to deal was .
to the one day , when they said , honey , it 's <unk> .
and today are you .
yes , <unk> .
because i opened the door and then i was sitting there is sort of in this <unk> , whoa , i felt thrown in the <unk> .
that looked like that , how it back then , we looked .
and that made as well , like how to school at it made , and i <unk> ' me , human being here , yes , real failure .
and when i then the teacher , say , i heard and you know , the kids learn not for the school , but for a 's live there <unk> ' i told me , oh my god , the sentence . i ' i yes , and you do n't <unk> .
what is that , what we from high school , from this high school , for a 's life that goes down to have ?
so many of us have <unk> there really good thing .
where they 've actually in your life <unk> , let 's really good need to ?
and you may have some of the capital from yugoslavia means .
what is , in yugoslavia ?
or <unk> , this ability in short time as much more knowledge in the <unk> , just , so i do it ended up on a button again <unk> can , until i really going ?
well , i , the time needed for the <unk> , but otherwise ?
and what 's a <unk> of one point is about , if somebody 's a good doctor 's going ?
if the empathic , is , and if the good diagnostic of it ?
no way .
so , no way , for a 's life , not for the school , we learn .
if we so back , so about <unk> years , the middle of <unk> century , like that yes , you have .
this is the time , in the in germany , the <unk> then eventually gets completely was introduced .
and where we also the system , how we it today , its roots .
and if we have the time , imagine , it was actually so , the people at the had no access to know their time .
and there were these four or six years , they sort of forced by , the school to go and with knowledge of been that were then we really the only way , and they had to get older , you know , and the facts and the information from their time in contact , .
now has a <unk> more information in his pocket of the library of time .
and the middle of <unk> century , that was the time the industrialization .
i mean , there , some changes in the world and there were suddenly humans need to these new machines have been able to .
simultaneously , but also human needs of these machines , wait , and fix it could .
and we need people that these machines to build it could and that these factories were running .
maybe you see it .
that <unk> system that we now in germany , you ask you still have , has its root in this time .
and a potentially make sense .
it 's , because it was probably really that was that , what i at school because i learned was , for the work on the assembly line well , who the assembly line up , stood there be for life .
we do <unk> at the future .
we let 's <unk> century , where it is , and we look at the year <unk> .
this year <unk> was the year , there was the first <unk> just about to pop .
i was with my studies done , and i thought , now is the time , now do you fall on the first company .
yes , after some of around me to the internet , <unk> ' i , <unk> ' i think that now , this time .
and some of companies are at us <unk> and they were bigger and bigger and , and we 're so you slowly grew , and some of the companies are then at us again , so in <unk> .
you see , two times in life .
and we then after a few years , 30 staff .
so , we had so , such a growth and we had so exciting professions , on how <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> .
i do n't know , if you ai n't have no idea , what these people do , but when i the school and we had no idea that 's so what ever would give them .
even when i <unk> did was from so what 's like the internet , you ca n't talk .
and the kids that we now the school to what good job to the in 10 , six , twenty or 30 years of ?
the only honest answer <unk> we have no idea .
and , which you know what kind of facts are the need to in those future jobs to succeed ?
and if you 're honest , because the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 've been so the future looking , who could tell me , because the <unk> for the saturday , there .
there 's <unk> the golden , i ' i read .
well , you see , they have no idea .
how we can get then got to school for a 's lives learning it ?
what are the things that we need to kids for a 's life to fit to do ?
and maybe it 's a view , in this , what companies today , they 're looking for .
that are , the <unk> of school , yeah ?
the alumni from schools and the universities are then in the company .
and if you , it ai classic <unk> yourself , then it , first place , so what the expertise .
because i want . yes , so the reading and so , we 're <unk> <unk> <unk> with 10 years <unk> and of 12 years in offshore .
there 's going to school , and also in the future ca n't afford .

and that you can essentially , in three to summarize .
this is , , businesses , want to the staff , the fact , so flexibility in this is a .
then you want to almost all their employees , they tend to think .
and then you want to these companies , the <unk> are .
so we have flexibility leaders , thinking and predicts that .
we start with the flexibility .
this is relatively quickly to understand .
if we look at the economy to work , how fast , yes , how fast , anything changes .
<unk> , yes , the whole business models are the internet , the morning , their head .
there practice , i , the with this change can deal .
there practice , i , the creative ways .
there practice , i , the <unk> are .
this is quite the opposite of the what in the factory in the <unk> century of collaborators at the line of it had .
also the second subject of the entrepreneurial think is quite clear .
there 's the responsibility .
there 's the people to take responsibility .
first time for , and their own life .
but also for that telescope .
if that 's now , the company is , or as well as a society , whatever we humans to take responsibility for that telescope .

and if we wanted to soccer cup , remember , then there 's because the web and this beautiful saying .
argentina , <unk> <unk> portugal , <unk> and germany has a team .
it was n't betti <unk> the world cup won .
that 's the only thing to create .
and so somebody , this big , and innovator our time , steve jobs , <unk> .
it was not the , the iphone have invented , has not the <unk> invented , has itunes n't invented , has n't know about being invented .
the had a team that made possible , because just as a team was able to do that what they 've done .
so it ai at school , these three things that could , about it ai at school , in the we for a 's lives learning .
but there 's still <unk> fourth thing and the is me almost more important .
and that learning is itself .
if the one , what we think about the future with safety saying that is that she 's uncertainty is then it 's the ability , and new to learn and fun and to have this learning to the <unk> that we in the future life , and that our children in the future life would succeed .
that if only , but it ai at school , these things that .
but where i was ?
i sat in this <unk> and the of them , the kids have to know that 's not just ai of this is , for the you <unk> to pay .
so it ai event , after the slogan all it said , not from each other .
to the time , where <unk> 're elected , there are then suddenly all the invisible .
yes , i sat there and what i say , <unk> of my kids were these <unk> , the funniest parts of the event .
less fun , it was for me as a father , if you so the stress around the subject of homework and learn the whole family <unk> .
and still less fun makes it , if the kid was going to because school in the stress this is now .
and finally ended up these <unk> or was a peak of <unk> at this school , again , so 'n <unk> .
and in it was also not <unk> , it was like it 's a <unk> , so right after the last one hour and in fact , we were also the single parents that were invited .
and i <unk> , you now , and also reminded me the detail by the time after the point was clear , we need to our child 's bring out that 's not .
<unk> , two years , in which we did have given that does anything not .
what do we really wrong ?
and we 'd actually the question put this is our child is broken ?
and we are the only , where it this is ?
now i ' i in the last two years , since i put in the subject to do with very many people talking and i did , and found , no way , ' learned , you 're not alone .
there are all kinds of that 's very similar to go and that was two years ago , because i was sitting with <unk> <unk> together we were just about ourselves , a new business to , have the day we thought , where the journey , there goes , and night , we sat on the bar and have us about the private things to be .
and what i say , he told me almost the same story of his kids , he almost as we experienced as we , and that we had been fortunate that we our children there 's take could from high school , yeah ?
in berlin , there 's one , it ai <unk> at different schools and we could even the charter schools in play off to .
but can that everyone out there are doing ?

and after we 're both now the idea that had to school , since we were there 's not that really changed we thought , yeah well , we are the first , the topic that now let go ahead .
just , how shall we as <unk> there anything to change ?
the good is that we deceive for .
we 're not alone .
but we have a relatively fast , ai whole range of amazing people found that what the like to how we , ai n't manage to create that everybody who are stacks up will .
it is yes , not that just the children and their parents down underneath the suffering , there 's so often happens .
if we the teachers to look , 30 percent of the teachers have <unk> .
if we look , the number <unk> in the last 10 years has changed the business , doubled .
it can now , that all parents to be doing ?
that all children dying , and that , these are breaking down are ?
or it be that we have a system , that simple , that fit , like this <unk> ago <unk> years , the fit just as well , so right .
and we have many people found that 's not that went and we even people found that do n't have kids .
and they 've understood that you take responsibility to the future that you take responsibility to the future , by showing you take responsibility for that , what we our children and the kids , now to school . go to hang on the way , there .
and we looked at <unk> second point gotten there 's out there ai whole range of one of initiatives , the school , and just want , and there 's there 's <unk> schools , here and there really neat <unk> and there 's almost at every school teacher , really involved , and a change .
and there 's even the , or another , courageous principal , then also <unk> the first step to go .
and how we should now as <unk> help ?
we had yes , no concept that there are now about helping us could .
but we can make one , we can in those schools , and we can look at those schools in the people , the school is , so the parents , the teachers and the students , together and we can with are in two days ai whole bunch of moving .
there are so people together , in the past , like each other have worked and the learning in two days , what it together to work .
that come with <unk> very first challenge of them together to solve .
and after two of those days , then , for a new <unk> developed sooner or the underdog , there , ai n't entirely new high as we 're in berlin to school , just to .
or the have no idea for , for <unk> problems that they do in your school , evolved .
inside of two days after all evolved to find that the next day , which can be .
but what that i could is , what these two days , and that makes it for me and so beautiful the few weekends , i , then also time , among schools , germany to spend , is this energy , there is what if the three things to learn .

so sort of the leaders , thinking and if you , his experience .
then is that a spark , etc. .
and if we are four weeks after that <unk> workshop , it ai n't manage to come back then you know , we 're going to the school as a whole has to change that there ai n't entirely new culture of that 's .
and this is incredible hot .
and i <unk> ' , invite them over the school to think .
i <unk> ' , invite , about education was thinking .
and i <unk> , they do so , also to invite , about , of school , to talk .
talk you about this , what you like , but i speak , they also that , what you do n't like .
they would be surprised , how much disturbed , they get and how many people did the have experienced , but just not talking about .
you make us , let us on every school in germany , the <unk> century , to .
you make us the entire system to change .
and you make us this together to do with the people to school day for a day off , with the parents , the teachers and the students .
because only thing we can do this .
thank you .
