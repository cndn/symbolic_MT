you know , of the big <unk> the travel and one of your children at the <unk> research is , together with the people to live performances that , the old days you can remember . the your past , still in the wind will feel , you on the rain <unk> of touch , in the bitter leaves the plants and taste .
just that know that <unk> still living beyond the milky way to travel , or the importance of myth the oldest of <unk> still covered with meaning , or that the himalayas and the buddhists still the breath of <unk> tracking , which means , the central epiphany of physical anthropology on the memory to call that 's the idea that the world , in the we live , not in a total of exists , but just as a model of reality , and as a a bunch of certain ways of these things that we know , <unk> succeed , in many generations of chose .
and of course , sharing , we all the same <unk> .
we 're all born . we get kids to the world .
we go through <unk> .
we need to us with the <unk> separation of the death of interest and we should it 's not surprise that we all the singing , dancing and and art , this .
but there 's the unique vocal cadence of <unk> , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and plays it does n't matter , whether it , the <unk> , in the of borneo -- is , or the <unk> in haiti , or the warrior down in the <unk> of <unk> , the <unk> in the andes , or a <unk> in the sahara . this is to the colleague , i a month ago in the desert , across 'm . or even a <unk> the on the <unk> , everest , the <unk> the world .
all these people teach us that 's still the other <unk> , some of thinking , other ways to where the earth there .
and that 's an idea that , if you think about , a with just hope for it .
and form of thousands of the world a net of <unk> and cultural life , that the earth <unk> and for the way of the earth as important is the biological <unk> , that you a biosphere that 's better .
you can , this cultural <unk> as a <unk> imagine . <unk> can and as the sum of thoughts and dreams , which is the ideas , my inspirations -- and everything , the human imagination ever since the beginnings of consciousness , being were to be defined .
the <unk> is the great legacy of humanity .
it 's a symbol of all to what we 're and what we as an amazing <unk> species can do .
and just like the biosphere , away , they did this with the <unk> -- only with still be the speed .
not a biologist to speak for example , dare to suggest that 50 percent or more of all species on the extinction , there 's just not true . and yet , this -- that <unk> <unk> the area of of biodiversity -- is not the , which gives us as <unk> <unk> the area of cultural diversity which is .
and the critical to be is the number of languages .
than any of them in this room was born , by the earth 's 6,000 different languages spoken language .
now is a language not just the set of the vocabulary or a series of <unk> .
a language is an expression of human spirit .
it 's a means , the soul of a culture has access to the material world finds oneself .
every language is like a <unk> forest of mind , an inflection point , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritual and opportunities .
and of those emotions and languages are today , as we 're here in monterey sit , exactly half of people , in the ears of children <unk> .
they 're going infants , they taught . i mean , if nothing done is , they 're actually been dead .
what could be lonely , as the silence <unk> , one of your people to be that your language to talk , no way to have to the wisdom of our science , or being able to kids to ?
and yet , stamp this horrible , which he actually , somebody somewhere on earth , about . all the two weeks , because of two weeks , die an older people and take the last <unk> an old language with the grave .
and i know that some of you say , it 's not better than that ? '' was the world 's not a better place , if we all just a language to be ? '' and i say , '' well , let this language , yoruba . let them <unk> be .
let them kogi . ''
and then they would suddenly realize , how it , if you their own language not could talk .
so i want you today 's kind of on a journey through the <unk> take a brief journey through the <unk> to try to you get to do , which actually been lost .
now there 's some sort of us , the way , forget , they said , when i say `` different ways of being , '' really different ways of being mean .
take them for this child the <unk> in the northwest , the amazon , the the <unk> , believe that they <unk> the <unk> from east , from the belly of latter-day saints , snakes <unk> .
this is a people , which is not being cognitively between the colors , blue and green is different , there 's <unk> the forest that the people depend , <unk> is .
they have a to language and a <unk> the linguistic <unk> is called , you have to get married , that one another language , talks .
all this is rooted in the mythological past . that appear in these big houses , in which of <unk> six or seven languages spoken to be , is , is that you never get it sounds , that one language is learning .
you 're just to and start then to talk .
or , one of the <unk> tribes , which i ever lived have to the <unk> in the northeast of ecuador , an amazing people , the first person in 1958 peaceful and i contacted by the world .

they threw a new photographs of the one of the air down , what we as kind , with them would . and forgetting that you that these people from the rainforest in her still never be something <unk> had seen .

but the <unk> killed , not only be with the spear .
they <unk> each other .
54 percent of deaths were happening through <unk> .
we followed the <unk> eight generations go back and found two million cases of natural death and when we the people with really something about <unk> , gave them to that one of the people that old , so it was that he 's because of his age , and we 're killing him still with the spear .
but at they had a clear ignoring the forest , the amazing .
they were hunters who were the urine of an animal from 40 up of the smell and determine , which species , this was part .
in the early <unk> years , i got a really amazing job , when i was my professor in the harvard , he said , if i believe it be interested , i was to go and the secret societies have to infiltrate the foundation of the strength of <unk> and <unk> <unk> , and the venom , for it was used to <unk> to try to make sure .
to this sensation having a sense , there had , i want something about this really believe in the <unk> know , and <unk> is not a cult of the black magic .
the point , it 's the time a complex , forget about the world .
it 's interesting .
if i they were to ask , the great world , or , what they would say ?
christianity , islam , in buddhism , <unk> or what that .
a continent will always leave out , because that he was that it in sub-saharan africa ca n't be religious faith and give them . course there 's a and <unk> is just this is , this very <unk> religious thought that during the tragic diaspora to the <unk> <unk> .
but what <unk> so interesting , is this is a relationship between the living and the dead .
the living bear the spirit .
the spirit can of the big water of evoking going to respond to the rhythm of the dance , the soul of living with whom out to , so that the <unk> for a shiny moment to god will .
<unk> say the <unk> to , `` your white is in the church , and you talk about god .
we dancing in the temples , and going to god . ''
and because you 're obsessed , me , you going to the mind by . how you damage the third danger going ?
you see these amazing demonstrations , <unk> in one had to the iron coal , without the burning <unk> , an amazing graph of the ability of mind the body like to influence that it <unk> , if it in a state of the extreme arousal , and then they will .
now , of all people that i 've got , were kind of kogi from the sierra nevada and de santa <unk> in <unk> , the most .
all around the old <unk> civilization , the <unk> plain from colombia world , and in a result of conquest , i moved , that people in a <unk> volcanic in no , that over the <unk> plain there .
in a <unk> continent , were these people are the only that never the <unk> conquered .
to the modern day , they become the ritual priesthood governed , the training to priesthood is , is very extraordinary .
the young <unk> be the age of three and four years of their families are separated and in a <unk> world , the dark , in <unk> the <unk> the glacier , for 18 years by that . two periods of each , nine years , you 're elected , the nine months of pregnancy emulate , they in which of her mother to contribute to spend them now <unk> in which the big mother .
and during this whole time , they become a cultural in the scores of society in place . values that the claim that that their prayer and only their prayer , the cosmic -- or we can say that environmental issues -- an equilibrium that .
the end of amazing <unk> you will be one day , a sudden , out and the first time in your life , the age of 18 years , you see a sunrise , and in this <unk> moment of consciousness of the first of light , if the sun 's starting on the <unk> the remarkably good landscape to radiation , suddenly everything that they in abstract 've learned in an amazing glory and confirmed . and the priest kick the past and says , `` you see ? it 's really , i 'll tell you have .
it 's so wonderful . you have it to protect them . ''
they call the older brother and say that we have that we the younger brother , for the destruction of the world are responsible .
now this level of intuition is very important .
and if we 're going to indigenous and the landscape , think , <unk> we 're either <unk> and the old lady who the fancy wild up , which in his simplification of <unk> idea is , or other thoreau and say , these people are more with the nature is connected , when we .
so , indigenous groups are n't sentimental , you will of nostalgia ill .
it is not a place for the <unk> swamps , <unk> or the cold winding of tibet , you have , but anyway , through time and the ritual a mysterious <unk> the world shaped , not the idea is based , you 're close to be , but on a far <unk> intuition , the idea that the earth , just existing communities that , because they 're in the human consciousness <unk> will .
now , which means that ?
it means that a little girl from the andes , in the think up the mountain in a <unk> is , his or her destiny to determine , is a very , another person , and a different relationship to this resource , or this place , as a little girl from montana , in the think up to a mountain in a bunch of stone is , in their can be .
if he had a location of mind or a bunch <unk> is , is irrelevant .
the interesting is the metaphor , which the relationship between the individual and the nature is defined .
i grew up in the woods of british colombia , and i believed that these forests , there are , <unk> to be .
that made me to a different people as my friends , among the <unk> , believe that these forests of the location of <unk> and the curved <unk> and the <unk> they are the <unk> the world in fact , spirit of them at their <unk> in would .
now , if you start , the idea to look at that these cultures and realities are able to you some of their extraordinary to understand , like . this plant here .
it 's a picture that i just last april , in the northwest , the amazon on .
this is <unk> , of a lot of you 've heard , the most sorts preparation for the repertoire of the shaman again .
what <unk> so , is not only that <unk> potential of this <unk> , but of processing . it 's really from two different sources that . the one side , there 's these wooden <unk> , the number of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , inherent benefits . this <unk> by taking that 's about as if , a blue <unk> smoke on their minds put , it 's , but with the leaves of <unk> from the family , the <unk> with the name <unk> <unk> up .
these plant , contains some very strong <unk> the top of serotonin , <unk> and <unk> very similar .
if you 've even the <unk> have seen , this stuff <unk> , this substance of them from different ways that contains one <unk> .
this <unk> to <unk> that 's about how from a <unk> throw , <unk> of <unk> paintings and the landing on a sea of electricity .
it 's no distortion of reality is , but the resolution of reality .
i even with my professor , richard <unk> <unk> , the man that the psychedelic <unk> with the discovery of the magic fungi in mexico in the <unk> years , i started , about being discussed . i said that you this <unk> not as <unk> known as i could , there in the moment in the you the effects of , you , there is to a <unk> to learn .
but the thing with <unk> is the that they do n't <unk> taken to return , because you through a in the human gut , <unk> enzyme , with names <unk> , <unk> be .
you can only in touch with a different chemicals <unk> by going to the mao <unk> .
now it 's fascinating that the <unk> , in the <unk> contain , <unk> of exactly the way , that is necessary to the <unk> to <unk> . you ask , so itself .
how can these people from a <unk> by 80,000 species <unk> plant these two , morphologically and not related to plant to find that , if this way , combined , a kind of <unk> version of creating so that the larger than the sum of its parts is ?
we use these great euphemism to try and error , what to be meaningless turns out .
but we ask you the native americans tell you , `` for the talks to us . ''
so , which means that ?
this tribe , the <unk> , 17 different varieties of <unk> that they all the great distance in realize that for our eyes of as the things .
and then ask you , their <unk> see it , and they say , i thought , you do something of plants .
i mean , you know anything at all ? '' and i said , `` no . ''
so , it turns out , that you any of 17 different varieties , <unk> absolute and they sing to move in a different <unk> .
so , that you to do n't finished in the harvard , but it 's more interesting than <unk> to count .
so , that <unk> the problem is that even the ones , given us , the concerns of the difficult to the native , you as <unk> and colorful , look , but somehow the past , to , during the world , which our world , progresses .
so , the fact is that you that in the 20th century . , in 300 years , not for his war or technological innovation will remember , but rather than at an era , in the we <unk> , and the massive destruction of the biological and cultural diversity around the earth , either in support his or a passive accept . so this problem is not the change .
all cultures , again , the dance with new <unk> involved .
and the problem is not the technology .
the <unk> were not less on the sioux , when you must bow and the arrow of tasks , as the americans who stopped americans , when you a horse and <unk> tasks .
ca n't change and technology could threaten the integrity of <unk> . it 's power . that could face the rule .
and where anything that you the world <unk> , you will discover that these cultures , not the of the <unk> are . that are : living people , whose existence through the visible very much , is the about their capacity of things , we go out . it and the <unk> logging in the country of the <unk> is , a <unk> from asia , of <unk> , a people , that , one generation freely in the forest , living , and now to <unk> and prostitution the river in , from where you can see that even the river with the mud , polluted water will , nearly half of borneo , in the <unk> sea <unk> seems . of where the japanese <unk> at it to see are that are willing to their <unk> with the raw <unk> to fill that they do the forest away . or how in the <unk> , where it <unk> are , during the <unk> <unk> were .
or if we in the mountains of tibet and go , where i <unk> much on , you that could face the political and dominance .
you know , the genocide that <unk> extinction of people 's kind of , but the <unk> , the destruction of lifestyle and the people , is not only in , but generally , and <unk> a <unk> celebrated .
and you can 's suffering <unk> n't understand , if you do n't it on <unk> level have seen .
and i went even with a young , or 6,000 of miles of <unk> in <unk> <unk> by <unk> after <unk> and only when i , <unk> and i saw the face the statistics of you hear . 6,000 holy monuments , in the rubble , and ash into . 1.2 million people that during the cultural revolution of the <unk> murdered by .

this meant that it during the chinese it immediately get killed by the world .
his uncle bug living with their sanctity of the diaspora , the people , nepal .
his mother was locked up , as much punishment to -- for the crime as straightforward .
he was the age of two years in the prison smuggled to , under your <unk> to hide , because they do without it 's not life could .
the twin sister , these <unk> did <unk> , in a <unk> to the country .
one day , stepped them out on them on a tags around and for these <unk> had them for seven years in a heavy camp .
the suffering <unk> can become intolerable , but the <unk> spirit of people 's something <unk> .
and the end up , we really , a choice . we want in a <unk> world , the <unk> or in a <unk> world , the diversity of life ?
margaret mead , now , the anthropologist who said before they died , it to make their greatest fear is that as we , one thread , <unk> , generic at the world move , we 're not just the whole range of human imagination , on a <unk> way down would see , but that we one day from a dream up , and i 've forgotten , it to make any other ways , there .
and it 's really humbling to go to think that our species , perhaps been over 600,000 years .
the <unk> revolution , the agriculture , got , and us in this moment the cult of <unk> <unk> , the poetry , the shaman looked through the prose that priesthood <unk> and hierarchy , specialization of surplus , created -- i found , just 10,000 years , instead .
the modern industrial world as we know it 's not have 300 years old .
now , this <unk> history tells me not that we all the answers on the challenges , that we 're in the next for millennia to stand .
if we those thousands and <unk> after the importance of human questions , the answers you with 10,000 various voices .
and in this song , we become the opportunity to rediscover that , what we are , people with into consciousness , the fact , the importance of these are that all people and gardens , a space , are being able to <unk> to deal . and there 's great moments of the optimism .
here 's a picture that i the northern hemisphere is the end <unk> had taken , when i do with <unk> on the <unk> went . and this man , <unk> , i told me a wonderful story of his <unk> .
the canadian government is not always very well with the <unk> others and during the <unk> years of the establishment of figuring out , they were forced also , settlements , to move .
the grandfather of the old man who refused .
the family , the fear to be life was , took him all of guns and all the tools .
now to you know that the <unk> not afraid of the cold . they used them to their advantage .
the <unk> their <unk> , originally from fish , in <unk> wrapped up , it .
the grandfather of the man was afraid , not going on the arctic night , or the <unk> storm .
he <unk> after the outside , made his pants off , <unk> down and <unk> in his hand . and as the feces to seize that started , shaped , he told them in the form of <unk> .
he <unk> saliva , the sides of <unk> and when it are frozen , <unk> he 's a dog with it .

so you come from nothing to do something .
and this is on many ways a symbol of the resistance of <unk> and all indigenous peoples in the world .
the canadian government had the <unk> in april 1999 , the complete control of an area , that 's bigger than california , texas .
it 's our new home country , and i mean <unk> .
it 's a completely independent area . they control all <unk> .
an amazing example , as a nation , the state of atonement with its people , and can achieve .
and ultimately , i think , it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us , to these distant for the earth , across , to realize that they do n't get away .
they are the <unk> of someone .
they represent the parts of human imagination , in the past when the way back . and for all of us to be the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our own children in the geography of hope .
what we look at national geographic , trying to do is that we believe that politicians ever to achieve .
we believe that <unk> -- we believe that <unk> not the case is , but we believe that storytelling in the world , and we 're probably the institution for storytelling in the world . our website , 35 million ones every month .
156 nations to send our tv .
our design magazines can be , read .
and we are a series of travel in the <unk> , which we our audience to places of such as cultural and wonder take you to the you just by going . and hopefully , they become one after the other to the central epiphany of physical anthropology on one : that this world , it deserves this , on different ways to exist out that we have a <unk> in a really multicultural <unk> world can find , the wisdom of all people to our shared and well-being can contribute .
thank you .
what i first , as quickly as possible , you 'll see , is the fundamental work , a new technology that we microsoft a <unk> ago exactly one year , who have . this is <unk> . and it 's an environment , in either you locally , or away with huge amounts of visual data can deal .
we see a lot , gigabytes of digital photographs here , that you would blend seamlessly , and that <unk> , pan , on any way to make arrangements .
and it 's no matter , how many of information we look , how large that collections , or how big the images are .
the most of these are the digital scanner with a camera , but this is for a scan of the congress and it 's in one area of 300 <unk> .
it does n't matter , because the one , what the performance of like this is cut it , is the number of a pixel in your screen in every moment . it also has a very flexible , architecture .
this is a whole book , a sample of <unk> .
this is <unk> house of <unk> . every tearing is a chapter .
to prove that is really to a text and not to a picture is , we do something like that do anything to really , showing that that 's an actual representation of <unk> and not a picture is .
maybe this is an artificial way , a <unk> to read .
i would it does n't recommend .
this is a <unk> case . this is a copy of the guardian .
every big image is the beginning of <unk> .
and that you really the pleasure and the good experience a real <unk> a magazine , or a newspaper to read , what , a kind of medium with several scales .
we also something the corner of these special edition of the guardian did .
we have a wrong with this is very high , which designed that much higher than with a normal this is , and we 've added to content to it .
if you the features of cars look like , they can see here .
or different models , or even a technical <unk> .
and this time , and really these ideas on , these constraints , there are a place on the screen arguments that .
we hope that this is n't add pop-ups and other nonsense , no longer means -- that should n't need to be .
obviously this is that mapping of the really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and i want this really not much to spend time , except to say that we also to this area that will .
but that are all roads in the united states .
<unk> the top of <unk> picture of the nasa .
you make us now something else out .
this is actually now live in the internet . it can <unk> .
this is a project with the name <unk> that 's really two different technologies together .
the one is <unk> and the other is a very good the research <unk> , noah <unk> , a <unk> the university of washington , under the advice from steve <unk> the <unk>
and rick <unk> of microsoft research , and did was . a very good working together .
so this is live in the internet . it will of <unk> by .
you can see that , if we these kinds of views , in which we by images through , can and this experience of a near-death , which do .
but the spatial can the images here is , indeed , of .
the <unk> have these pictures together , lasted so you the real space , these images of the near the <unk> <unk> in the canadian rockies were made , equal . you see here elements of <unk> slides , or <unk> <unk> and these things were all in the relationship with myself on .
i do n't know , if i still time you have you very different environments to show .
there 's what kind of a lot of spatial .
i 'd like for a the original pieces of about showing and this is by an early prototype of <unk> in which we first time in summer 've been working to you that to show , i think that 's really the same punchline on this technology , the <unk> is . and this is not so obviously , the environments , that we the site .
we had the lawyers , etc . to do .
this is a <unk> the cathedral <unk> lady , the only in the computer with images from flickr and after . give you just <unk> lady in the flickr , and they are pictures of men in a t-shirt and the <unk> etc . get . each of orange <unk> represents a picture that as to this model <unk> was discovered .
so they 're this all <unk> , and they all stand in this way in the relationship with each other .
and we can be in this very simple way to navigate .
. you know , i 've never believed that i ended up with microsoft 're going .
i 'm very grateful for the had this .
. i suspect , you can see that it 's a lot of the cameras are , everything is that , of the <unk> to do it <unk> , a pretty large number of them , all in this environment me .
and when possible , i 'm a couple of weird to .
many of them , many faces , with , etc .
somewhere here are a series of photographs -- here are you .
this is actually a poster of <unk> lady , the right recorded by the world .
we can of the poster to a physical view this environment and change .
the point is this point that stuff with the social environment , and then it can . it will now data from all gathered together -- the entire of memory of the way , visually , the planet looks -- and everything is connected to .
all these photographs are going to each and it 's something that 's bigger than the sum of the parts .
they get a model that from around the earth , that .
at them that as the sequel of labor of stephen <unk> of virtual earth .
and that 's something that through the complexity , the people using it , growing and to use for the user , with the application bigger and will .
their own photos are dealing with metadata <unk> , the one another person got masses .
if , somebody the trouble has done and all this kind of them , and becomes , who you 're all and it 's my photo of the <unk> <unk> suddenly , with all that 's held and i can you when i started using to in this space to come , in this <unk> , the photos of the other people use and a kind of <unk> <unk> social experience with the use of other players doing .
and of course , as all of the people are immense , rich , virtual models of any interesting part of earth , not just by <unk> or a satellite and so on the were , but through collective of memory .
thank you .
. i do you right ? their software to to a certain point , within the next few years , all images , somebody in the world together to be used in principle of all linked to be ?
yes . they do anything else than to discover .
if you want , made them to hyperlinks , between the images .
and they do this because of the content in the images .
and that 's really exciting , you look at the wealth of the semantic information to think that many of these images have .
as if you a <unk> for images make , where they got your and the the site of a lot of information about , which is that 's .
but what about it , if this picture them with all their pictures of the reason ?
then is the scope of the semantic <unk> and the wealth , the , it basically , really enormous . it 's a classic <unk> .
<unk> , it is really incredible , congratulations .
you have much .
i 'll tell you some things from my book about the , i hope , in unison with other things are the they have heard . and i 'm trying to myself a couple of connections to create , if you this is n't noticed there are .
i want to the start , what i `` the official dogma '' i call .
the official dogma of what ?
the official <unk> of all western industrialized world societies .
the official dogma in it 's so , if our goal is to maximize the common our own citizens , is , about this , through the <unk> the freedom of individuals .
the reason for this is that freedom , to itself is good , valuable to make sense , a <unk> principal requirement for the human .
when people freedom , then is all of us for , the to do things that our public good to maximize and nobody has for us to decide .
the freedom to maximize that choice to maximize efficient .
ever more choices , people have , more and more of freedom of them . and ever more of freedom , they have , more and more common good , you .
this is , i think , so deeply in our water ones that 's not in the sense to come to it to ask questions .
and it 's also deeply in our lives rooted in .
i 'll tell you some of giving , which gives us to step forward to .
this is my supermarket . not a big .
i just something about <unk> say .

so that 's what the supermarket .
and then they 're going to the <unk> business plan to a <unk> an -- some speakers , <unk> , a <unk> , radio , are . and in a surplus electronics , which is there 's so many <unk> facilities .
we can <unk> millions of different <unk> why i put out of the components that in a business are going .
they must admit that 's a large selection is .
in other areas -- the world of communication .
there 's a time , when i 'm a boy , because you could every phone , hosts of the you wanted , as he , ma bell was .
they have your phone <unk> . they have it <unk>
a consequence of it was that the phone ever broken .
these days are over .
we 've now almost an infinite selection , phones , especially in the world of mobile phones .
that are the mobile phones , the future .
my favorite is in the middle -- <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> torch around .
and they should be that until now , not in your business have seen , you can be sure that it 's going to be .
and what it does it 's going to help people to the business to go and this question is to .
you know now what the answer that question is ?
the answer is `` no . ''
it 's not possible a phone to buy that 's not to be much does .
in other aspects of life , the very much more important than that buy one of objects are , hit the same explosion of choices to .
health -- it 's not known for the case in the united states that you to the doctor , and the doctor says , you what to do .
instead they 're going to the doctor and the doctor says , you : why we have a to make or why we have b .
a , has these benefits and risks .
b has these benefits and risks . what you want to do ?
and they say , `` doctor , so what i do ? ''
the doctor says , a , has these benefits and risks and b has those benefits and risks .
what you want to do ?
and if you say , `` if you i would , doctor , what would you do ? ''
the doctor says , `` but i 'm not you . ''
the result is -- that 's called `` patient , autonomy . '' that sounds like a good thing , but in reality is a shift the burden of responsibility for the meeting of making of someone to know -- namely the doctor -- to someone who is n't know , and to be sick is , and why not in the best constitution , is a decision to meet -- namely the patient .
there 's such a marketing , <unk> medicine for people like , and me , that , if you think about , does n't make sense , because we do n't you buy .
why are going to them to us , if we do n't we can buy ?
the answer is : they sort of us the doctor in the next morning to call and to a change the prescription to ask .
something so profound as our identity is now a question of choice , like this slide to demonstrate .
we 'd not an identity , we make them .
and we make us so often to examine how we want .
that means that every day , if you the morning , wake up , you to decide , what a kind of person you could be really want .
in terms of marriage and family , there 's a time , in the <unk> is , almost every one had and that you so fast were married , as you could , and so fast as children got , as you could .
the only true that election , `` who '' , when , and not what they then we did .
nowadays everything is just have them .
i 'm teaching a lot of intelligent , students , and i 'll give you 20 percent less work as i used to be doing .
and that 's not because , smart , and not because , carefully .
it 's because you with other things too are , you ask , , `` i married , or not ? i 'm going to marry ?
i later , marry ? i just have kids , or just a career making ? ''
that are all <unk> questions .
and they are these questions regardless of if that means that all the in to do that i do you <unk> and a bad grade in my class to get one .
and actually , they should do this . that are important to <unk> questions .
work -- we 're blessed , as carl that , with the technology is the us to every minute by each day from any place on the planet to work -- until the <unk> hotel .
there 's actually a corner , of the i did n't tell me , in the <unk> works .
i 'm it does n't tell you , because i use it wants .
so what it , this extraordinary freedom of choice we have in terms of choices to meet , and again , and again , whether we have to work or not have to work .
we can our children with the football games are watching , and we have our mobile phone in a hip , and our blackberry , other hip , and our laptop probably going on our lap .
and if you all off , every minute , we our child , <unk> of a soccer never ask , we also , `` i should this call assume ?
i should be in this email back ? should i 've got this letter writing ? ''
and if the answer to the question `` no , '' is it certainly in your experience of <unk> their children 's <unk> very different than it would have been .
everywhere , where we look , great things and little things that material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
and the world , we lived looked like this .
so i want to say , there 's a few options , but not everything was a question of choice .
and the world , we now live looks like this .
and the question is , are the good or bad news ?
the answer is `` yes .
we all know what good at this is , so i 'm about what one of it 's .
all these choices we have two effects , two or negative effects on people .
an effect , <unk> way , is that he 's this , instead to be free .
with so many options out of the you pick it , it people very hard to do need to decide .
i 'm going to a another <unk> example going to give a study about investing in them <unk> .
a colleague from me had access to <unk> of <unk> , the giant <unk> of about a million employees and i think about . 2000 , very different jobs .
and what they found was a 10 <unk> of employers offered it , took the part in the two percent .
they 're 50 <unk> , -- 10 percent fewer people taking part of as if you just five to be . why ?
because it 50 <unk> are the selection are , it 's so hard to decide what you choose to that it 's the morning off .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow 's obviously never .
you know that 's not just means that people <unk> to eat when they come in retirement go , because they 're not enough money to undertake , it also means that make decisions that hard is that she 's great <unk> your employers to miss .
by the not participating in give them to around the u.s. dollars per year on the future employer , the happy would have been their contributions to reproduce .
of this is a consequence of to many options .
and i think it makes for the world looks like this .
they want to the decision really make , if it for all eternity is , right ?
they do n't want the wrong investment fund to vote , or even the <unk> .
so this is an effect . the other side effect is that even if we the tale of over , and make a decision , by saying we have less happy with the result of the selection , as if we the way i 'd like us between a few ways to decide .
and there 's several reasons for this .
one of them is upon by the large variety of different <unk> , if you buy one , and it 's not perfect -- and , which <unk> 's been perfect ? it 's easy to imagine that she 's a different decision like you can meet the better would have been . and what happens is to visualize an alternative that leads to you the choice we regret , and this regret that i 'm on the average happiness , you some of their impacts are that had , as well , if it 's a decision was .
ever more opportunities there 's , more and easier is it does nothing to regret that 's getting there for the choice that they meet .
secondly , what economists <unk> call .
dan , gilbert 's a big point now this morning , made by he told as a very , the way , we 're sort of them , it depends on to what we it 's conceivable .
well , if it 's a lot of alternatives to think there , it 's easy , attractive of one of alternatives that they exclude , that makes them less happy with the alternatives that they voted for .
here 's an example . for the of them , no new yorker , sorry i .
but here is , what they have thought should .
here 's a couple of the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous beach . great day . they have it all for themselves .
what could be better ? `` damn ! '' the man who thinks , `` it 's august .
everybody in my <unk> neighborhood , is the way .
i could directly , my house park . ''
and he spend two weeks of the thought to follow that he the opportunity again , day , one day , a great parking lot to have .
<unk> reduce the average happiness that we by our choice to get , as well , if that what we think you 've been fantastic .
and ever more ways it on the choice , there , more and more attractive properties of choices be in the <unk> into account .
here 's a another example .
now , this cartoon is doing some statements .
he makes a statement about the right now to live and maybe about things too slow to do .
but an important point , he does is , and if you , for one thing to decide they have the other things not to do .
and these other things like a lot of an attractive properties , and it , what they do n't be less appealing to do .
three : <unk> the expectations .
this , i met , when i my jeans they wanted .
i 'm jeans , almost all the time .
and there 's a time , it just me to a way that there , and they have you bought , and they have a bad <unk> , they were incredibly <unk> and if you long enough by and often enough clean had , you have begun , `` ok . '' <unk> .
so i went to new me to buy after many years of <unk> the old , and i said , `` i 'd like a few jeans , here 's my size . ''
and the sales , `` you want to risk , <unk> or of the place ?
you want buttons , or <unk> ? rock or the acid bathed in ?
you want to me with holes ?
you want to the bottom , cut , <unk> , <unk> <unk> <unk> ... '' and so he told .
my jaw was down and after i started rebounding , i said , `` i 'd like the way that used to the only way . ''
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour with all these up and jeans <unk> , and spread the business -- and i say the truth -- with the best put me , i ever did .
i did it better . all these choices that allowed it me it better to have .
but i felt bad .
why ? i wrote a whole book , to try it to myself to understand .
the reason for me to me , i felt was , with all that we have opportunities , and expectations of that , which for a few jeans is , went up .
i had very low expectations . i did not the expectations , as it you just in a kind there .
when you in a hundred species that came to damn , one of you have a perfectly to be ,
and what i was good , but it was n't perfect .
and so i compared to what i have had to what i expected , and what i was getting there , compared to the what i expected .
the of opportunities in the lives of people increases is the expectations of the people have about how well , these opportunities to be .
and this leads to less great satisfaction with the results , the results .
nobody in the world of marketing do this . because , if you it would say , you know what they all not what it 's the .
the truth is more like this .
the reason is that used everything was better than anything worse , than anything worse , it was for the people can experience to make the a surprise was .
now , in the world , we live -- we 're wealthy , one thing that citizens , perfection , as an expectation -- the best for that you ever hope it 's the things that well , as you do it of you expect .
they 'll never let 's surprised . because your expectations , and expectations , <unk> are .
the secret to -- -- that 's what they all come are -- the secret to -- they have expectations .
i want to say -- for a little <unk> moment -- that i do with a woman was married , i 'm , and she 's really wonderful .
i of it could n't do better . i did n't <unk> .
but they preferred that 's not always like a bad thing .
finally , a consequence of <unk> a bad at recognizing me if it just a kind to buy there is that if you there are , and they 're wondering why , who is responsible , the answer is clear . the world is responsible . what would you can do ?
if hundreds of different kinds of me are available , and they buy one of getting there is , and they 're wondering why , who 's in ?
it 's also clear that the answer to the question is , you .
they have it better can do .
with a hundred different kinds of me to the windows , there 's no excuse for error .
and so , when people make decisions , and if the results make decisions are good , feel about it and disappointed about , they actually to themselves .
clinical depression , exploded in the industrial world in the past generation .
i think a <unk> -- not the only , but a <unk> <unk> to this explosion of depression , and also the suicide , this is that people who 've learned that there are because their standards , so high . and then , if you , these experiences , explain to , you think it would be your fault .
and that 's <unk> that it 's generally better go , objective , and we 're bad feeling .
so let me take you remember .
this is the official dogma , that one that we all , right to completely wrong . it 's not true .
there 's no question , a choice is better than no , but it is not , the more selection is better than a choice .
there 's a magical lot . i do n't know what it 's .
i 'm pretty sure that we need to that long as you have the variety of our public good way .
now , as a policy question -- i 'm almost finished -- as a policy question , the thing about the thinking is . that what all these choices to the world societies , is the material that wealth .
there 's many places in the world , and we went by many of you heard about to the problem is not the beginning to be large selection is .
your problem is that she 's a little bit .
so the things , i 'm telling you 're an odd thing with the modern , rich , that of societies .
and what 's so extremely frustrating and on is : steve levitt , you briefly yesterday about it tells how this is more and hard to <unk> <unk> n't help . it 's a waste of money .
what i 'm telling you is that expensive , trying to make decisions -- it 's not easy , that they do n't help .
they 're actually hurt .
they 're going into that we got there are .
if something of the what the people in our society to this big decisions to come to the societies in which people to a variety of what would , would not only that live in the people increases , but we would also be improved .
economists call this one <unk> application .
<unk> going to worry that everybody 's better about -- not just the poor -- because all these large variety of us <unk> .
finally , read you to this cartoon , and , a one person , says , `` ah ! what do this fish ?
you know it possible in this <unk> . ''
<unk> imagination , one by shortsighted of the world -- and that 's the way as i do it to read what you have .
ever more , but i thought about , more and more i came to the view , that the fish to know .
because the truth is that if you that <unk> break , so that it 's possible , you have no freedom . they have a lesion .
if you that <unk> break , so that it 's possible , down , the average happiness .
they increase of paralysis and reduce the average happiness .
everyone needs a <unk> .
this is almost with one of security to be limited -- possibly also for the fish , definitely for us .
but that <unk> be from a metaphorical <unk> is a recipe for children , and , i suspect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i think about some of projects are already been talking , over the genome and what that means that , and over the discovery of groups of genes .
actually start , we of a new point , we have the biology and digitized , and now we try to the digital code in a new phase of biology to get by we new life create , and build .
we 've always trying to great questions to imagine .
what 's life ? it 's something , i think that many biologists have tried to understand and this in different levels .
we have different approaches tried to it until the minimum components to simplify them .
we have nearly 20 years of digitized . when we that <unk> sequenced , it was the transition from the analog world of biology to digital world , the computer .
now we 're trying to ask , whether we live , you what can or whether we new life to create , because of digital universe ?
this is the map of a small organism , mycoplasma <unk> , the smallest genome of species has the time , in there will replicate it . and we tried to see if we that with a , smaller genome that can be .
we 've done it on about a hundred genes to share with the 500 or so , here .
but if we were those metabolic map at that are very simple is , in comparison to our . you can trust me , that 's pretty straightforward . but if we all those genes , watch that we one after the other to eliminate can it 's very unlikely that this to a living cell to be .
so we 've determined that 's the only way , looking forward is that chromosome in fact , to synthesize , which allows us the top of the components to <unk> and some of the fundamental question is to .
and so we started to the question , we can a chromosome , synthesize patterns ?
what it 's the chemistry of these really big molecule to build this is still never been done before ?
and , if we that can , we in the chromosome start ?
a chromosome one is the way , just a piece <unk> chemical material .
our first steps in the digitization of life were growing exponentially .
our ability of genetic code to write , very slowly developed , but nevertheless , increased . and our final point was now on an exponential curve that .
we 've got 15 years ago , so i started .
it actually a few years , starting with a <unk> review , before we the first experiments , and did .
how to put out is <unk> very difficult .
there 's tens of machines around the world , the little pieces of dna that can , 30 to 50 letter a long , but it 's a <unk> process , so ever known for you a piece of power , you cut more error is happening .
so we had a new way to come up with the we these little pieces together and the error correct could .
this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information , the genome phi x 174 countries .
it 's a virus that the bacteria and killing .
so we made a little pieces , did a <unk> and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting to the came when we this piece <unk> chemical and in a bacterium , and this bacterium in the genetic code to read and viral particles .
the viral them were then the cells that would and they came back and killed , e. coli .
recently i did with the <unk> spoken and they said that you this model just figure out .
they were laughing , more than her , it 's where does .
so we think that a situation is in the software in fact that your hardware can build in a biological system .
but we wanted , a lot go on . we want a whole <unk> chromosome , building . it has more than <unk> letters of genetic code . so we thought , we build it in it on the size of the virus , what we need the size it <unk> able to understand what the top of the components of living cell .
design is the key , and if you with digital information in computers will just want to this digital information that way to be .
when we the genome for the first in sequence , was the <unk> in a per 10,000 base pairs .
we found the <unk> 30 mistakes . if we the original sequence that have it would never been possible <unk> .
a part of the is it , pieces to the minimum of letters for , and the with other <unk> pieces overlap need to get smaller <unk> to build with these together .
we have a unique elements of this into .
you might have heard that we <unk> into .
you think about it for : we have a <unk> code : a , c , g and t .
<unk> of letters -- these letters actually encode about 20 amino acids , and there 's a single what matters for each of amino acids .
so we can the genetic code using about our words , to write sentences , thoughts .
and then we only signed .
some people were being that 's no new poetry was .
we have the pieces that 's that we 're just with enzymes , though they could . there 's that the this repair and back together .
and we 've started pieces to create , starting with pieces of five to <unk> letters in terms , added these people to <unk> to try to this back into , to <unk> .
in every step , we have these pieces in the surplus produced by that we 're sequencing ; they could , because we looked at a very robust , to create what it in a minute will see .
we tried to point of <unk> to get .
so that looks out of like a <unk> .
if we need to these really big do get -- with over 100,000 pair of -- then we are these are not just in e. coli that grow . it adds up all possibilities of modern molecular biology . and so well , we other mechanisms to .
we knew from a mechanism of <unk> <unk> is called , the biology is used to dna to fix that these pieces together .
here 's an example of them . there 's an organism , called <unk> <unk> the three million , look at , fine .
you see the top of the field to be a chromosome , just cut down .
12 , 24 hours later , , everything again this is how it was .
we have thousands of organisms that can do that .
these organisms that can totally <unk> , you can even in the vacuum life .
i 'm absolutely certain that live in space that exists , can move , the quest for <unk> conditions .
indeed , the nasa has shown that 's a lot of them out there are .
here 's a <unk> of the molecule that we 've created by we these things have used -- actually we only <unk> used to the right design the pieces we have you <unk> . yeast and so these then automatically comes together .
this is not <unk> it 's a regular micrograph of .
it 's a big molecule that 's even with the <unk> can see .
that these images about a whole duration of six seconds .
this is the <unk> that we just recently finished have asked .
that are about <unk> letters , hiding the code . it 's the largest molecule , <unk> structure that any of people who was created .
it has a <unk> of over 300 million .
if we have a <unk> of 10 and without the distances of print would it would <unk> pages from just to this genetic code <unk> .
now , how to start to a chromosome out ? how we activate it ?
obviously this is that it with a virus , very simple . it is more with bacteria to deal .
it 's also be easier if you put it in <unk> how we , it does : you just take the nucleus out and there is a different in , and this is that 's exactly what they all over the advantage of 've heard .
in <unk> is that chromosome in the cell into but recently , we have shown that you is a transplant of a chromosome from one cell to another that can make and to activate it .
we have cleaned that chromosome one <unk> . speaking , these two as far from how people and animals . we gave some <unk> , so we found that chromosome out to be able to . we <unk> and enzymes , all these proteins to destroy , and it was very amazing when we it in a cell , gave -- and they 're going to our very <unk> 're here we estimate --
this new chromosome in to cell .
in fact , we thought that 's the end is , but we tried to the process that there are going to earth .
this is the <unk> of here .
we find all kinds of species here , a second chromosome in , or a third of <unk> , every time , thousands of one in just a second to a species <unk> .
people , the evolution can imagine , as a gene that 's a moment changed will have a lot of the biology , again .
there 's that the <unk> be called the fact , dna and digest .
that chromosome out that in the cell was has n't ; the chromosomes , we put them have been .

it <unk> the blue , because of the genes that we put them .
and after a very short time , it was all the characteristics of species over and <unk> completely in a new species , based on the new software that we in the cell have given .

it may sound like the genomic <unk> sound , but we can , by we the <unk> here , things quite dramatic change .
now i argues that it 's not the <unk> is -- that 's based on 3.5 billion years of evolution
and i argues that we possibly do that are a new form of the cambrian explosion to create in the it 's massive whole new <unk> based on this digital media design that there might .
why should we do that ?
i think it 's pretty clearly in terms of what we need .
we 're doing that of six to nine billion people in the next 40 years <unk> .
now , it in my connection to ask : i was in 1946 .
today are three people on this planet for each of the person in 1946 , there has ; within of 40 years , it 's four .
we have problems with food , fresh and clean water , medicine , fuel for six billion people .
it 's a challenge that for nine to offer .
we need about five billion tons of coal , <unk> billion for every oil . that are a hundred million every the day .
if we of biological processes are thinking , or any of the to replace , it becomes a huge challenge .
then , of course , there 's the co2 from this material that in the end up .
we 've now , from our discoveries from around the world , a database , about 20 million of genes , and i want to believe that the <unk> the future .
the <unk> had a dozen components and you see the diversity of the it was .
we hit here in the first line of the boundaries of the biological reality , and that our imagination .
we 've now technologies of these rapid <unk> the three to do what we <unk> genetics .
we 've now the possibility of a robot to build the millions of chromosomes , the day can create .
if you imagine those 20 million of genes are making , or this way to optimize the octane make or drugs new vaccines , we can do with a just small team , a molecular biology , as the last 20 years of science .
and it 's just <unk> selection . we can , <unk> <unk> , one of chemicals , or <unk> <unk> and so forth .
this is a micrograph of that 's really <unk> , we work , you , actually sit down and new species on the computer to design <unk>
you know , we could n't necessarily as it will look . we know exactly how their genetic code looks like this is .
what we are now the fossil fuels the fourth generation .
they have recently , corn , to be ethanol seeing what 's just a bad tv experiment .
we have fuels the <unk> and third generation of relatively soon out to the much higher <unk> will have to octane or different kinds of <unk> .
but , how we think , the only way to biology is a big impact , another spike in the cost on food or the reduction of the availability , it is , if we co2 as a source material , and therefore we 're working at cells that way to go ,
and we think that we the first with <unk> the fourth generation will be , and that in about 18 months .
the sunlight and co2 we 're a method --
but -- in our discovery of the world , we 've all kinds of different ways .
this is an organism , we 1996 , described .
he lives in the deep , <unk> miles deep , in virtually <unk> <unk> .
it into carbon dioxide in methane to under the use of hydrogen as energy .

within a short time , we think , we could in the be able to one of basic questions of life to solve .
you know , we 've really -- <unk> goals , like the substitute the petrochemical industry . exactly when you do n't that ted , i could do , where else ? a <unk> the energy to be .
but as we 're now , the same two approaches to the vaccines to speak .
they have it this year with the flu in that we 're always a year in the back off and have a dollar a little bit , if it to the right lasts all about .
i think that it can be done by showing you <unk> vaccines , in sufficient .
this is it , like the future , possibly could look with changes , can now the <unk> it also be with synthetic bacteria , <unk> , and maybe some <unk> .
we are light years of the people to innovate . our goal is it 's only that we have a chance long enough to survive to that potentially to do . thanks !
the last ted conference , i put an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to go back to come to explain how the machine works .
now , it 's so here . and for all those at the n't there were , the lhc is the science experiment , which you ever been approached by -- 27 miles in diameter .
its task is it , the conditions to create , which is less than a <unk> second , after the universe <unk> -- and that to 600 million times within a second .
it 's just so very poor .
this is the machine , below , geneva .
we take pictures of <unk> in the detectors on .
at that i work . he called the atlas detector , of feet in the width , 22 feet in diameter .
here 's a spectacular picture of an atlas off in the construction , so you the scale .
the 10 . september the last year was the machine , the first time .
and this picture was from an atlas .
it was making huge <unk> in control room .
it 's a picture of the first <unk> which the way across the lhc <unk> , you 're dealing with a part of the lhc <unk> to a rain from the particles in the detector <unk> to them .
in other words , when we took this the 10 . september at , we knew that the machine works , what a huge victory .
i do n't know , whether this the biggest <unk> generated , this , as someone the google side to and the front page that i found .
it means that we have a cultural of the scientific trade .
about a week , there 's a problem with the machine that with these <unk> here to do was -- this golden wires in here .
those wires run <unk> <unk> when the machine on <unk> it .
now the engineers , you 're going to look at and say , `` no , that they do n't . that are small wires . ''
you can that contribute , because if you very far cooling , they going to call <unk> .
at minus <unk> degrees , cooler than the space between the stars , can see those wires in the tension and endurance .
in the connections , and piles of <unk> magnet inside the lhc , there 's a <unk> .
so heat , the wires are and <unk> <unk> out into a sudden <unk> resistance .
this was the result .
now , all this is still a wonderful when you imagine , that the magnet about 20 tons weigh , and the time about . 30 inches move .
we were so about 50 the magnet
and they had to remove , what we also did .
we <unk> they 're going to say , <unk> you .
they 're now all back on their way back .
against the end of the march is the lhc , again <unk> be .
we 're going to him turn , and expect the first data in june , or maybe july 're able to , and put our journey on , to see what the building blocks the universe .
now , of course , on a kind tapped those accidents to the debate to value of the science and <unk> , such planetary boundaries . it 's easy , that reject .
i think the fact , it 's very difficult , the fact that we about our planetary boundaries out to reach , is the value of things like the lhc .
i 'm going to my element words , one english scientists to leave . humphrey <unk> , the , as i , when he was the most useless experiments , of <unk> ruling , his student , michael <unk> , this , `` nothing is dangerous for the development of human spirit , when i assume that our scientific ideas on , that 's no mysteries in nature is that our triumphs <unk> are , and that 's no new worlds to china is there . ''
thank you .
i 'm a writer .
books to write is my profession , but it is more than that .
it 's also my big , for life , love and fascination .
and i do n't expect to that ever change is .
but it 's recent something weird in my life and my career start to that gave me that has brought to my to this work , completely to rethink together .
this to the event is , i recently wrote a book of have -- a biography called <unk> , <unk> , <unk> -- that , decided different than all my previous books , for some in the world beyond and a <unk> , international <unk> was .
the result is , they said , matter where i come to be treated well let me as if i the of the <unk> .
seriously -- the of the <unk> !
for example , you very concerned on me , and say , if you are not that they do this success never by going ?
you have not afraid that you to all their lives <unk> and never again a book , that anybody in the world wants to know ? never again ? ''
okay , it 's really the courage .
it would be however , even worse , when i do n't remember this would , they said , about 20 years , when i like , the first time of them told me to a writer , wanted to be , with the same kind of <unk> response faced was me .
the people said , were you 're not afraid , ever been to have ?
you no fear that you the humiliation of rejection killing ?
you no longer afraid you to the craft , your life for <unk> and it never heard something that and that you on a <unk> <unk> dreams are going -- your mouth with the bitter ashes in the space failure ? ''
so roughly , you know .
the answer -- the short answer on these questions is : <unk>
yes , i 'm afraid of all those things .
and that i had always .
and i , much more things , that no <unk> would .
like this -- and other <unk> things .

it 's about ?
it 's obvious that by someone to be that 's greatest fear that has to work to do to the he had to get to feel ?
and what exactly the creative , there was going on that it 's not about the other <unk> do -- in a kind of how it other professions have n't do ?
my father , for example , was a chemist , and i ca , not a situation in his dream 40 years as a chemist , remember , in the he was asked , if he afraid to have , chemist .
with your <unk> , john -- how it 's hear you that ?
it was just not , you know ?
but to be fair to be -- the group of the chemist , over the centuries , not the reputation of <unk> <unk> people get .
we who seem , but this kind of call you have them . but not just the writer , but the creative of genres , like this call to have mental , it 's unstable .
everything that they need to do , is , the bitter <unk> of really great minds from just the in the 20th century . at the young and a lot of their own hand , died .
and even the ones who do n't actually <unk> <unk> , the tracks from their talents to actually used to have been to be .
norman <unk> said , a moment ago , he died in his last interview , <unk> my books , i was a little further <unk>
an extraordinary thing that you about her life can do .
but we our n't even if we get that tell you hear , because we all these kinds of statements for so long time to know , somehow we have the african attitude that level and offers accepted that creativity and tired of course <unk> and that art -- the end -- always going to <unk> leads .
the question , i am today , here 's think about this is : is this idea for them completely in order ?
you feel the comfortable with ? because with one inch by looking at -- i feel with of not comfortable .
i think they become really .
and i think they 're dangerous . and i do n't want to watch , the next century , by 2027 .
i think it 's better , if we asked of creative encourage to live .
and i know definitely , it for me -- in my situation -- very dangerous to be able to start , this dark path of things will sort of <unk> -- especially in the fact , i in my career , am .
that means -- you see , i 'm very young . i 'm only about . 40 years old .
i may yet another 40 <unk> in me .
and it 's extremely likely that everything , what i went from now , going to write the world as the work they will , after the <unk> success of my last book came , right ?
i say it straightforward , because we 're here , yes , all of friends -- it 's most likely to my greatest and behind me .
oh , jesus , which for a thought !
that are sort of the idea that somebody to do you 're going to 9 morning to start , <unk> to drink . and that i want to do n't .
i 'd like to continue this work to do that i love .
so is the question : how ?
, after a the <unk> me like to come to continue to write down to , a kind of <unk> psychological are building design must .
somehow i have to from now on a way to find the can write a safe distance , right between me and my very natural <unk> about the same reaction , that 's not going to be .
i was in the last year after the models for looking for you have the three to do , i also in the past , looking for and i tried to other societies have to begin to see , if you might better or <unk> ideas about it did when we how to creative can help , with the emotional risks to deal to creativity are connected .
this for me around the ancient greece and the ancient rome .
please , they told me , because the bubble is the back to close .
but in ancient greece and rome have the people did n't believe that creativity of people , okay ?
they believed that creativity of <unk> <unk> was , from a distant , and unknown to the people coming -- from <unk> , and unknown things .
the greeks called the divine <unk> of creativity <unk> .
from socrates is known that he 's it was , he had a <unk> , and wisdom of on the distance , which .
the roman had the same idea , called this kind of <unk> creative spirit of <unk> .
this is great . the roman and we were n't really , a genius , a very clever which was .
they believed that a genius with that magic divine beings who was that we did was that 's literally in the walls of <unk> lives -- about as <unk> , the <unk> -- the <unk> and the artists in the work of invisible <unk> and the outcome of design would .
that 's brilliant , there is it , there 's the distance , of the i was , who are building , you look at the consequences of your work to protect .
and everybody knew , it worked , right ?
the organizers of the <unk> was a certain things done , like , for example , of <unk> , right ?
if your work , brilliant , were , and you do anything you look for you consult . everybody knew you to this <unk> genius did that you helped them .
if your work <unk> -- not entirely , your mistakes , right ?
everybody knew , your genius , was something <unk> .
so , people in the west , really long time about creativity , while .
and the renaissance and everything changed . we had this great idea . and this great idea was , let 's the individual the center of the universe , imagine -- about all the gods and mystery . and there 's no room , for the unicorn creatures , the orders of divinity .
it 's the rational humanism , and the people started to believe that creativity is completely off the own individual needs came .
the first time in history of it , you people , or those of a genius call -- instead of that he 's a genius .
i must tell you : i think that was a mistake .
you know ? i think , a naked person to allow that he thinks , he or she was like that at the pelvis and the essence , and the source of divinity , creative , unknown , an mystery is a little bit of responsibility to move them a <unk> , human psychology of an even .
it 's how someone to ask , the sun to swallow .
that of the and distorted by the ego and it 's all these <unk> expectations of the success .
i think that the <unk> our artists , the last 500 years out .
and when it 's true , -- and i think , it 's true -- is the question :
we change ?
maybe a we’ve understanding of the relationship between humans and the mystery of creative and return .
maybe not .
maybe we that <unk> from 500 years , rational humanism , not just in a <unk> talk , the chance .
and there 's certainly the people in this audience , really fair , to register , over the idea of -- basically -- <unk> , the people <unk> and <unk> on their projects , etc . apply them .
i 'm probably not all of them on this journey , you can take .
but the question , i represent , i want is : why not ?
why not so think about ?
because it as much sense of how do anything other that i 've got , if it 's about that just completely <unk> <unk> the creative process to understand .
a process , -- like everybody knows , it ever tried , something to make -- so in other words , actually , here -- not always as to behave .
in fact , it , sometimes , literally <unk> feel .
i had recently that sort of what did when i the extraordinary example , poet <unk> stone , i met , well over 90 is , but all their lives for a poet . they told me that you when the <unk> virginia up out the fields have worked . they said , they would feel and to listen as a poem written about the landscape on them <unk> .
they said it would like a <unk> move from the air ,
the more about the country on them <unk> would .
they felt , if it came , because it would the earth , under their feet to <unk> bring .
they knew that you in fact that moment is only one could do . and this was -- in her words -- <unk> like the <unk> .
they ran out how the devil to the house while you from this poem that was being . it was only about that she quickly enough to one of paper and a pen , into had to make it , if it through them <unk> to capture , and the sheet , that could .
in another painting , not fast enough . they ran and ran and ran , but they reached the house , and the poem and she would through them and you missed it . they said it was going on the country to and -- how they said -- <unk> a different compared to <unk> .
and then there were these moments -- the part i 'll never forget -- they said that it moments , there in which she 's almost missed .
so , she runs to the house and for the paper and the poem is going through them and they 're with a just as it through them <unk> and then -- she said -- it was so when i 'd love with their other hand , we reach and it to get .
you five miles the poem in its tail and moved it back in your body and it 's took on the of paper .
in these opportunities that came the poem do and intact , the paper , -- but it backwards -- from last word for the first .
when i think that i heard that i thought this is an incredible -- that 's exactly how to my creative process <unk>
this is not like my creative process -- i 'm not the channel .
i 'm a <unk> . to work to i have to every day , the same time to get up and sweat , i struggle and really pretty uncomfortable <unk> .
but even i held in <unk> 've sometimes this thing <unk> .
and i guess that many of them , we have done .
even i had to work or ideas , from a source of me <unk> that , i do n't identify it .
what is that for a thing ?
and how we step , so in the relationship with no about our minds to lose , but for us in the opposite , even in mental health to balance ?
for me is the living for example of how to this to be the musician and tom <unk> . i got him a few years ago for a magazine interview .

but then he was getting older and quiet . he told me that he 's one day , <unk> in going to los angeles , and so , and there , everything changed for him .
he went with high speed as he suddenly a simple patch a melody hear that , how it in my inspirations are often is , for him <unk> hard it 's . and he wants you have . it 's gorgeous . he <unk> then , but he can you ca n't .
he 's not a piece of paper , he 's not a pen , he has no <unk> .
he begins , these old <unk> in him up , like , `` i 'm going to this thing to lose and i 'm coming from this song on forever are .
i 'm not good enough , i can do it up . ''
but instead of panic , to get , he heard just on .
he ended up all the <unk> and doing something completely new .
he looked at just in the sky and said , <unk> , you ca n't see that i car to drive ? ''
<unk> i was so , when i could just a song it down ?
if you really exist want to come to a <unk> moment , again , when i have to you do it .
if not , <unk> today , somebody else .
go and <unk> leonard <unk>
his whole <unk> , after that changed .
not the work itself . that was to do this dark matter how they said , and ever .
but the process and the heavy <unk> , it around , was up when he 's genius from , it took , where he 's nothing more than the trouble was making and it to betrayal , where he sort of came from . he realized that 's not an automatic , <unk> thing had to be .
it was a <unk> , miraculous , bizarre , working there , a conversation and tom , and the <unk> , <unk> thing that 's not quite tom was .
when i do this story about this one of have changed it a little bit of the way , i worked and it has made me , even have saved .
this idea that saved me when i in <unk> of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> was . i fell in one of dug the <unk> in the we all fail , if we look at something to work and it does n't . you <unk> , to think that 's a disaster is . this is the bottom of the book , that ever was written .
not only thing , but the bottom of all time .
i started to think , i should pull this just <unk> .
but then i remembered it , like tom opens onto the free the sky was talking and i tried it .
i was so my view from the manuscript , and spoke to comment , an empty the corner of the room .
i spoke out loud , `` stop , you thing , you and i know them , if this book , not brilliant , this is that 's not completely my fault , is , right ?
because you see , yes , everything that i , <unk> . i 'm not even more than that .
if you get it so much we have to , you got here show up and your of the deal , all .
okay . but , if you do n't do -- you know what , to the devil with it .
i 'm and writing , because it 's my job .
and i want to please , and give me to come today for my part of jobs here <unk>
because -- the end it 's how to follow . centuries ago , , in the deserts <unk> people to <unk> with the sacred and music and music around , for a funeral ceremony has been -- to <unk> .
this kind of these were always been great , because of dancers were highly professional and they were fantastic .
but , and again , very rare , was something special . one of the performer , was actually <unk> .
and i know that you know , what i mean , because i know that they all in your life , one of performance , have seen .
it was as the time <unk> and the dancer , through a kind <unk> step . he did n't something different than he 's ever before has done -- a thousand , nights earlier . but everything on the together .
and very suddenly appeared he did n't no longer in human .
he was from up and of the bottom up and everything we lit the a divine fire .
when that at that happened to know the people what that was . they called it in his name .
they put the hands together and began to sing : <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , god , god , <unk>
this is god , you know ?
what you can buy it , as the <unk> <unk> <unk> they brought this practice , with . the way it changed , over the centuries of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> to <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , that you still in <unk> and <unk> hear .
if a performer , in spain a <unk> , something magic has done , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , great , <unk> the more , there is it , a glimpse at the god .
and that 's amazing , because we need that .
but , the tricky part follows the next morning , if the dancer from ourselves up and see that 's 11 o'clock at a tuesday -- is -- and he does no longer a <unk> of god in the wearing .
he 's just an aging mortal with <unk> at . and maybe he will never again to these heights up .
and perhaps will never again , god 's name out , when he said , about . but what is he then with the rest of his life begin ?
that 's hard .
this is one of <unk> done some of creative life .
but maybe it does not quite so full of the anguish , if you in the first , we did n't have to the most aspects of being , of you move it .
if you might just think that you a loaner are -- from an export source for a <unk> time your life , at somebody else , down is , if you 've done it .
if we start , like to think it changes all this .
so i started to think , and so i think , certainly in the past few months , while i the book working , that 's coming out is -- as the dangerous to appetite , strong to really <unk> my <unk> success .
what i always on ourselves to say , i guess that i 'm going , is : i did n't afraid .
do n't be can .
just do your job .
that would continue for your contribution , what that he may be .
when your job that dance is , dance .
if the dumb on , genius , that you to the side , which is to decide , for a moment , yet done by miracles through your effort to show , <unk> ! ''
and if not , dance , yet your dance .
and <unk> ! '' for you , despite all this .
i believe it and i feel that we should be the teaching .
<unk> ! '' for you , despite all this , just for you to the mere human universal love and the <unk> talk about it , that they measure .
thank you .
thank you .
<unk> !
last year , i have these slides , shown to illustrate that the arctic <unk> to the near the three million years of the size of the bottom of 48 states had to 40 percent down .
but that there 's not be strong enough to the seriousness , this particular problem , there 's not the thickness of the ice is the world .
in a sense , is the arctic <unk> that beating heart of our global <unk> .
she grows in winter and -- in summer .
the next slide that i do you 'll show , is a <unk> what in the last 25 years happened .
that <unk> , it 's labeled correctly .
as you see , it 's on the blue is to . this is the year by ice in winter , and it -- in summer .
that 's called <unk> , five years old or older , is almost like blood , which of the body , here <unk> .
in 25 years , it from here , here 's gone .
this is a problem , because the rise in the frozen reason the arctic ocean <unk> , it , very large amounts of <unk> carbon out there , which , when he <unk> , of microbes , methane , which is .
comparing with the entire amount of <unk> materials in the atmosphere , could , this will double , if we 've got this critical point cross .
already today <unk> in some of shallow lakes in alaska and methane from ourselves of the water .
professor <unk> walter the university in alaska , of another task force to a different shallow seas last winter , across .
wow !
she 's good . the question is , how would have to us through .
and a reason is , this enormous amount of heat up with the greenland from the north .
this is a year <unk> .
but the volume , are much bigger than ever .
this is the <unk> river in <unk> greenland .
if you want to know how the heavens through <unk> up here <unk> you the ocean .
those rivers , rapidly to .
the other end of the planet , to antarctica , the largest mass on the planet .
last month up and researchers in the entire continent now a negative <unk> .
and the <unk> the a few <unk> up is , is very strong in the melting .
this is 20 feet above sea level , greenland .
in the himalayas , the <unk> mass , you see the top of lakes , a few years glaciers were .
40 percent of people in the world get the half of their <unk> of this <unk> .
in the andes , is this glacier , the <unk> for this town .
the as well , the <unk> .
but if you <unk> , will also the most of water <unk> .
in california was a 40 percent reduction in the <unk> the sierra seen .
this in the <unk> .
and the predictions , you read , they are seriously .
this <unk> in the world to play a dramatic increase the fire .
and the disaster in the world have in a really <unk> and she 'd never an unprecedented degree up .
times as many in the last 30 years , like the <unk> 75 .
this is a completely <unk> <unk> .
if you this in the historical context of yourself , you can see , what it <unk> .
in the last five years , we have 70 million tons of co2 produced at all of 24 hours -- 25 million tons of every day in the oceans .
you look at the progress in the eastern pacific , right , from the continent , west and both the indian <unk> , where it 's a drastically decline of oxygen in the ocean there .
the largest single factor for the global warming , deforestation , which is 20 percent is , is the burning of fossil fuels .
it 's a problem , and coal is that 's nevertheless biggest problem .
the united states are one of those two major <unk> , and with china .
and the suggestion was , many more <unk> to build .
but we start , a change to see .
here are the , in recent years , painted by , with some green are alternatives , proposed by .
<unk> there 's a political , in in our country .
and the <unk> and <unk> have a <unk> dollars last <unk> spent to clean coal to apply that , a contradiction in the middle .
this reminded me of something .
the christmas around them off , with me to home in tennessee , a billion tons <unk> .
they have it <unk> in the news seen .
this is in our whole country , the <unk> can america .
this happened to the christmas .
one of the commercials , the <unk> the christmas was this .
<unk> the <unk> is a <unk> , happy -- .
it 's in the shell and wealth in america , and he helps our economy to grow .
<unk> , the <unk> is every day , clean .
he is affordable , and <unk> , and the workers will remain in wages , and bread .
this is the source of the most of coal in west virginia .
the most <unk> is the heads of <unk> coal .
, let me a very clear to say , al gore , nancy <unk> , harry <unk> , they do n't know , what they talk .
so , the alliance for <unk> two to be doing the in '' .
this is one , a part of her .
in the <unk> we see the climate change , as a serious at risk for our business .
so we have it 's have to the top <unk> to actually , a significant <unk> spend about a <unk> on the way to the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal is not much .
we think , it 's clean -- and it 's also still good .
so , to do n't worry about the climate .
leave you take this us .
<unk> coal , they have a lot about it .
so , let us a tour of modern , clean <unk> do .
fantastic ! this machine is quite loud .
but it 's the sound of clean <unk> .
and yet the burning of coal , one of the main reasons for the global warming is that were remarkably , clean <unk> that you see here , it changes everything .
you take it , right , this is the world today , clean <unk> .
finally grew up the positive is -- with our economic challenge and our challenge the national security .
america 's a climate crisis , the economy , the national security , the climate crisis .
the major thread , these all together , is our dependence of <unk> <unk> like the dirty and coal and <unk> oil .
but now there 's a bold , new solutions to us from this <unk> able to be free .
<unk> america , 100 percent cleaner , electricity to say , within the next 10 years .
a plan , america , back to work to bring to us safer , and to help , the global warming , to stop .
finally , a solution , the big enough is , our to solve problems .
<unk> america . they get more out .
this is the last thing .
it 's about a <unk> of america .
one of the fastest way , our dependence of the old , diapers <unk> that our world , one , to reduce .
the future is here . wind , the sun and a new energy system .
new investments to well , and paid for jobs to create .
<unk> america . it 's time , reality to embrace .
there 's an old african saying : `` if you be fast you want to go alone .
if you very far come you want to go together . ''
we need to go far come , quickly .
thank you .
so i want to begin to ask them , the time your childhood <unk> , when you with <unk> played .
while they realized how to the hands out and <unk> , the <unk> pick up and moves , they learned in fact , to think , and problems through the understanding and change the spatial what 's going to solve .
the spatial can think is closely with being connected spaces , we have a lot of our environment to understand .
as a scientist -- inspired by the kind of our interaction with real physical objects -- and with my <unk> <unk> and my colleagues <unk> <unk> , i began to be wondering : what would , if we use computers were , instead of <unk> , as a digital <unk> on one was tie these moves -- what would , if we do with both hands were could and data , physically , who and it that actually could , how we it want ?
this question was so really , that we need to study of the answer is going on and <unk> developed .
in short , a <unk> is an interactive computer in the size of <unk> .
you can with the hand be moved , and you can each other as well , you can get their movements that , and they have a screen and a <unk> .
more importantly , they 're physically , why you like blocks are merely by that reach the hands and access can move .
and the <unk> are an example of a new generation of <unk> the manipulation of digital data .
and if these tools <unk> , and a consciousness for your movement to develop , to recognize and the intricacies of our <unk> with you see , then we do with the study of new and <unk> <unk> start .
i 'll start with some simple example .
this <unk> is for the <unk> <unk> and if i told him in a direction <unk> , the video . move it ; if i told him in the other <unk> , is it backwards .
and this interactive portraits , the aid becomes true .
if i do you so next to peel , and that their interest .
if you <unk> are surrounded , notice them , and we can think about going .
and they feel as their movements and slope .
an interesting a result of interactions , we need to see it started , was that we keep everyday gestures on the data to be , as color so to them into how to this with <unk> does .
in this case , we have three <unk> as <unk> <unk> and i can use them to paint in the middle to pour , then mixed use .
if we it carried , we can get a little <unk> .

i 'm here -- that 's a fibonacci numbers that i a simple <unk> to draw .
this is a game with words , a kind of <unk> and <unk> is .
basically , you get any going on every <unk> to <unk> letters and while you 're trying to words to form , this talk about a dictionary went through .
then , after about 30 seconds , is back up and you have a new <unk> and new ways to try .
thank you .
that are some kids , a trip to the media lab and it . i could you to move , it to try and have a video of taken .
they have it really loved .
an interesting fact , this kind of applications is that you to the people not a lot of them there must .
everything else you to say is `` you words , '' and you know exactly what to do .
here are still a few people that 's test .
this is our youngest <unk> down there right .
it turned out , he said to the <unk> just a pile i want .
so for him , they were just blocks .
this is an interactive <unk> .
we want a own for <unk> develop .
this is <unk> .
he can create new characters in the scene , to , by and he <unk> out of the on top , this figure shows .
here it 's the sun work .
the sun goes on
now speeding up he 's a <unk> in the scene .
the orange <unk> .
good job ! yeah !
and he the <unk> shake and you , one puts it the characters are so ...
i brought his own story to invent .
hello !
it 's a story with open up and he can decide , how they evolved .
flying his cat .
the last example , for that i am today , you have , it to show , is a <unk> for <unk> , that recently we 've developed and in the <unk> as a sound , <unk> , singing and the drums , operate .
each has four different variations , you can choose , which you to use .
and you can this sounds in the sequence -- that again in any of them .
and you <unk> you , by showing you just a <unk> to a <unk> holding .
there are the effects that you live can change , like . hall and filter .
you connect him with a particular sound , and one from him and then to hire .
and then still the overarching effects , like the speed and the volume , you on the entire sequence that gets .
so , let me .
we start , we the <unk> in two <unk> -- and this in a series of them , they expand and a little bit more the voice to it .
now in -- i have a bass , adding positives .
now i 'm still a play drums .
and now , up to the filters out with the drums , so i the effect on the control it .
i can the entire sequence or speed , by now , at the one or other direction <unk> .
and now , up to the filter , with the bass , for something more expression .

so i have to do n't you in the reservations are planning , but you improvise , you to myself do you could shrink .
and finally , in the entire sequence <unk> , by , i <unk> after the left , i tend to .
thank you .
so as you can see , is my desire to think it , new <unk> to the better to fit , how our brains and body work .
and today , i had time , you a part of these new <unk> and some of possibilities of going to show , what we in our lab to work .
the idea that i them with the want to leave that we the threshold to this new generation of <unk> to interact with digital media are , the information in our world to bring that our needs to .
thank you ,
i 'm on the talks with you all !
